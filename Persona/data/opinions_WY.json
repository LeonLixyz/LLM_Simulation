What, if anything, needs to be done to control the costs of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare?\n\nCandidates' Stances:\n- A: Donald Trump (Former U.S. President, businessman)\n  Stance: Trump has promised to protect Social Security and Medicare, which are the biggest drivers of the national debt. \"Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security,\" Trump said in a January 2023 video message distributed by his campaign. The national debt increased by $7.8 trillion during Trump's presidency, the third-biggest increase relative to the U.S. economy's size, ProPublica reported.\n\n- B: Kamala Harris (Current U.S. Vice President, former Senator)\n  Stance: Harris wants to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, according to her campaign, but she has yet to release detailed policy proposals. She has taken the Biden administration stance on Social Security, supporting a measure to reinstate the payroll tax on earned income above $400,000. She has also said she would as president allow Medicare to accelerate negotiations on prescription drug prices, which are part of the administration's existing efforts to lower drug costs. In 2019, she co-sponsored a bill to expand Social Security by extending the payroll tax. She proposed a Medicare-for-All plan during her 2020 presidential bid, but she is not pursuing such a policy now.\n\n###YOUR RESPONSE###\n\n",

      "reason": "As a Sustainability Consultant, Ryan Thompson is deeply concerned about the economic implications of climate change and the need for sustainable job creation. However, he also has a strong sense of social responsibility and values the importance of social safety nets. Given his background and economic situation, Ryan is likely to be cautious about drastic changes to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, especially if they could negatively impact vulnerable populations or his own long-term financial security. He may also be skeptical of politicians who have a history of increasing the national debt. On the other hand, he might be open to proposals that aim to strengthen these programs while also addressing their long-term sustainability.",
