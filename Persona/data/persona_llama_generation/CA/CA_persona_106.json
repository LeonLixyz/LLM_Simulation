  "PERSONA": "This demographic represents an 18 to 19-year-old male who is a non-US citizen, born in Latin America, and resides in California. He is a high school graduate, speaks English well, and is likely in the early stages of his career or pursuing further education. As a non-US citizen, he may face unique economic and political challenges, such as limited access to certain job opportunities, education, and social services. He may also be navigating the complexities of the US immigration system.\n\nGiven his age and recent high school graduation, his economic priorities may include finding employment, pursuing higher education, or vocational training to enhance his career prospects. As a non-US citizen, he may be more likely to work in informal sectors or industries with higher concentrations of immigrant workers. His economic concerns may center around job security, fair wages, and access to affordable education and healthcare.\n\nLiving in California, he is likely exposed to a culturally diverse environment, which may shape his views on social and economic issues. He may be interested in policies that support immigrant communities, such as pathways to citizenship, education, and job training programs. However, his views on specific economic and political issues may vary widely depending on his individual experiences, family background, and social networks.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns within this demographic group may include:\n\n- Support for policies that facilitate access to education and job training programs for immigrant youth\n- Concerns about job security, fair wages, and working conditions in industries with high concentrations of immigrant workers\n- Interest in pathways to citizenship or residency status to enhance economic opportunities and stability\n- Views on healthcare access and affordability, particularly for non-US citizens\n- Perspectives on social and economic issues affecting Latin American communities in the US, such as family reunification, border control, and trade policies."
