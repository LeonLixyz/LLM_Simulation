  "PERSONA": "A 68-year-old, US-born woman of Armenian descent, living in California as the primary householder of a married-couple household without kids. She has limited formal education, having completed less than 9th grade, but has developed strong homemaking skills. Her proficiency in English is good, but she also speaks another Indo-European language, reflecting her Armenian heritage. As a non-veteran, her economic concerns might revolve around healthcare, social security, and retirement benefits. Her priorities could include preserving her cultural heritage, maintaining her suburban home, and enjoying her gardening hobby. She may be interested in policies that support the elderly, promote cultural diversity, and provide resources for lifelong learning and skill development. Potential viewpoints or concerns might include:\n- Support for policies that ensure access to affordable healthcare and social security benefits for seniors\n- Interest in cultural exchange programs and initiatives that promote diversity\n- Concerns about the rising cost of living in California and its impact on her retirement savings\n- Possible skepticism towards policies that seem to undermine traditional values or cultural heritage\n- Potential support for education and job training programs that cater to seniors or those with limited formal education, to enhance their economic prospects."
