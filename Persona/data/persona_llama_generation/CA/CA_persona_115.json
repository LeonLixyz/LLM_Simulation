  "PERSONA": "A 45- to 54-year-old US-born Chinese woman, living in California with her spouse. As the primary household decision-maker, she holds a bachelor's degree, which likely contributes to a relatively stable economic situation. She may work in a professional sector, possibly in a field related to her degree. Although her English proficiency is limited, she has adapted to living in the US, potentially utilizing her skills in a diverse range of industries. \n\nHer marital status indicates a long-term commitment, suggesting a shared financial responsibility and planning with her spouse. Without children, the couple's financial priorities may focus on homeownership, retirement savings, and investments. As a resident of California, she might face high living costs, particularly housing expenses, and may be concerned about affordable housing, taxes, and the overall cost of living.\n\nGiven her background, this individual may hold diverse views on economic and political issues, such as:\n- Concerns about affordable healthcare and social security due to her age and limited English proficiency.\n- Prioritizing education, as she values her own educational background and may support policies that promote access to quality education.\n- Support for policies addressing high living costs in California, such as rent control or affordable housing initiatives.\n- Potential interest in environmental policies, given California's strong focus on sustainability and environmental protection.\n- Possible support for immigrant rights and language accessibility, reflecting her own experiences as a Chinese-American with limited English proficiency."
