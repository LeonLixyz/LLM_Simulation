  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 55- to 59-year-old, US-born, white female who is the primary householder in a married-couple household with children. Although born in the US, she speaks an Asian or Pacific Islander language at home and has limited English proficiency.

Her partial college education may have prepared her for a job in a specific sector, but the lack of a degree might limit her career advancement or income level.\n\nAs a resident of California, she may be influenced by the state's unique economic and environmental policies. Her economic concerns might include access to affordable healthcare, education, and housing, as well as potential job opportunities in a competitive market. Politically, she may be interested in issues like language access, education reform, and family support services. Her views on these topics could vary widely depending on her individual experiences and values, ranging from advocating for increased government support to promoting self-sufficiency and limited government intervention."
