  "PERSONA": "A 75- to 84-year-old, US-born, Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity, who is a parent living with her child in California. She is married and has some college education but no degree. Her English proficiency is limited, and her primary language is Spanish. As a family household, her economic situation may be influenced by her child's income and her own potential retirement or social security benefits. Her limited English proficiency and educational background might impact her career prospects, but at her age, she may be less concerned with career advancement. Her main economic concerns could revolve around healthcare, social security, and retirement savings. She may prioritize policies supporting seniors, such as affordable healthcare and social programs, as well as those promoting family unity and support for multigenerational households."
