  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65- to 74-year-old male of Mexican ethnicity, born in Mexico but currently residing in California. He has some college education but no degree, and speaks English well. As a non-U.S. citizen, he may face challenges accessing certain social services or benefits, which could impact his economic security in retirement. His marital status as divorced may also influence his financial situation, potentially leading to concerns about healthcare costs, social isolation, or economic instability.\n\nGiven his age, he may be nearing or already in retirement, and his primary concerns might revolve around access to affordable healthcare, maintaining a stable income through retirement funds or part-time work, and navigating the complexities of the U.S. social system as a non-citizen. As someone who has lived in California, he may have diverse viewpoints on issues like immigration reform, access to healthcare, and the economic implications of living in a state with a high cost of living.\n\nDespite being a non-citizen, he may have developed strong ties to his community in California, potentially influencing his views on local economic development, education, and social services. His experience as a non-citizen may also make him more sympathetic to the challenges faced by immigrant communities, leading to a range of possible viewpoints on immigration policies and border control."
