  "PERSONA": "A 25- to 34-year-old married white female, born in the United States, and a US citizen. She lives with her parents in California, likely due to financial or personal reasons. She holds a graduate or professional degree, which suggests she has had access to higher education and potentially has a higher earning potential. However, her living situation might indicate that she is still in the process of establishing her career or is experiencing financial constraints.\n\nHer high level of education could lead to concerns about student loan debt, career advancement, and job security. As a resident of California, she may be concerned about the state's high cost of living, particularly housing costs, and the impact of state policies on her career prospects. Her marital status might also influence her views on family planning, healthcare, and work-life balance.\n\nGiven her education level, she might prioritize issues like access to affordable education, career opportunities, and policies supporting young professionals. Her living situation could also make her more aware of the need for affordable housing options and support for young families. As a resident of California, she may be more environmentally conscious and supportive of policies addressing climate change. However, her specific concerns and priorities can vary depending on her individual circumstances and experiences."
