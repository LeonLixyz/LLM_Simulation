With an educational background of 9th to 12th grade and no diploma, her career prospects may have been limited. However, her current economic situation could be influenced by her spouse's income and their combined household resources.\n\nAs a resident of California, she may face concerns related to the high cost of living, particularly housing costs and access to affordable healthcare in her senior years.
