  "PERSONA": "A 60-64-year-old, never-married, Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity living in California. She is a high school graduate, speaks English well, and has never served in the military. As the primary householder of a single female household without kids, her economic situation might be centered around her own needs and financial priorities.\n\nHer high school education may have influenced her career prospects, potentially leading to lower- to moderate-paying jobs. Given her age, she may be nearing or already in retirement, which could impact her economic concerns and priorities. As a non-U.S. citizen, she may face limitations in accessing certain benefits, social services, or employment opportunities.\n\nLiving in California, she may experience a relatively high cost of living, which could affect her views on economic policies related to housing, healthcare, and social welfare. Her location in an urban or suburban area of California could also influence her concerns about transportation, education, and local governance.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns she might have:\n\n- Economic security in retirement, including access to affordable healthcare and housing.\n- Immigration policies, particularly those affecting her status as a non-U.S. citizen.\n- Education and job training programs to enhance her career prospects or those of her community.\n- Local and state policies addressing the high cost of living in California.\n- Healthcare access and affordability, especially as she ages.\n- Potential limitations and challenges faced by non-U.S. citizens in accessing social services and benefits.\n\nThis persona acknowledges the diversity within the demographic group by recognizing that individual experiences may vary based on factors such as immigration status, education, and location."
