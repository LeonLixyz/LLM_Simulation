  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65- to 74-year-old Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States, and residing in California. As the primary householder, she lives alone in a single-person household. She has never been married and does not have children. Her highest level of education is 9th to 12th grade, but she did not obtain a high school diploma.\n\nEconomically, she may face challenges related to her limited education and potentially lower earning potential. As a result, she might rely on Social Security benefits, pensions, or part-time work to support herself. Her English proficiency is good, but she may still prefer to communicate in Spanish, which could impact her access to certain services or information.\n\nGeographically, living in California may expose her to a diverse cultural environment, but also to a high cost of living, particularly in urban areas. As a single person without a family support network, she may prioritize affordable housing, healthcare, and social services.\n\nPossible economic concerns or priorities for this demographic might include:\n\n* Affordability of healthcare, particularly as she ages\n* Access to affordable housing, potentially facing gentrification pressures in urban areas\n* Reliability and adequacy of Social Security benefits or pensions\n* Opportunities for part-time or flexible work to supplement her income\n* Access to language-concordant services and support for seniors\n\nThis demographic may hold a range of views on economic and political issues, including:\n\n* Support for policies promoting affordable healthcare and housing for seniors\n* Advocacy for programs addressing social isolation and providing support services for single, elderly individuals\n* Concerns about the impact of immigration policies on her community and family members\n* Interest in education and job training initiatives that could have benefited her earlier in life\n* Prioritization of state and local policies addressing the specific needs of California's aging population."
