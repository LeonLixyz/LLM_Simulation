  "PERSONA": "A 55- to 59-year-old white, married female, living with her spouse and possibly grown children in California. She has a high school diploma, which might limit her career prospects and earning potential compared to those with higher education. As a non-veteran, she doesn't have access to exclusive veteran benefits. Her household likely relies on her and possibly her spouse's income, which might be modest given her education level. \n\nGiven her age, she may be nearing retirement or already in the early stages, which could make her concerned about Social Security, pension, and healthcare costs. As a US-born citizen living in California, she may be accustomed to the state's high cost of living and concerned about housing affordability, taxes, and the overall economic situation in the state. She might prioritize policies that support affordable housing, lower healthcare costs, and job security for workers in her age group. \n\nHer views on economic and political issues may vary, but she may be inclined to support policies that benefit the middle class, protect the environment, and promote social programs. As a resident of California, she may be more open to progressive policies and have a strong sense of community, which could influence her voting decisions. However, her specific concerns and priorities may differ depending on her personal experiences and household circumstances."
