  "PERSONA": "This 55- to 59-year-old woman is a US-born citizen, residing in California. She holds a graduate or professional degree, which likely contributes to her advanced career prospects and higher earning potential. Despite her education and age, she lives with her parents, possibly due to caregiving responsibilities or economic factors such as the high cost of living in California. As a single individual who has never been married, her financial priorities might focus on supporting herself and her family, including retirement savings and healthcare costs.\n\nGiven her education level and residency in California, she may be concerned about issues like affordable housing, access to quality education, and healthcare reform. She may also prioritize environmental policies and social justice, which are often prominent in California's political landscape. However, her specific views could vary depending on her profession, personal experiences, and local community.\n\nAs a non-veteran, she may not have direct connections to military or veteran's issues, but she could be interested in broader national security and foreign policy discussions. Her command of English and higher education suggest she may be well-informed and engaged in local and national politics, with a focus on policies affecting her family, community, and professional interests."
