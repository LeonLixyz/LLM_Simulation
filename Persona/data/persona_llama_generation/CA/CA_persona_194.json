  "PERSONA": "A 20- to 24-year-old married white male living in California. He is the primary household member and speaks an Asian or Pacific Islander language at home, but also speaks English well. Having less than a 9th-grade education may limit his job opportunities and income potential. As a result, he might be employed in low-skilled or service-oriented sectors with lower wages. His household may rely on his income, which could cause economic concerns about financial stability and security. Given his demographic, potential economic concerns or priorities might include access to affordable education or vocational training, job opportunities with better pay, and affordable healthcare options.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic might include:\n- Supporting policies that provide affordable education or vocational training to increase job prospects.\n- Advocating for higher minimum wages or better working conditions in low-skilled sectors.\n- Prioritizing affordable healthcare options, especially if his spouse or future family members require medical care.\n- Being interested in policies addressing income inequality and economic mobility.\n- Having mixed views on immigration policies due to his language background and the potential impact on job competition.\n- Focusing on local California-specific economic issues, such as housing affordability and cost of living, given the state's high expenses."
