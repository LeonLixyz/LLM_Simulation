  "PERSONA": "A 35- to 44-year-old, foreign-born woman of Asian descent, who is a U.S. citizen and speaks English well. As the primary household holder of a non-traditional household structure, likely a single mother, she has a high school diploma and possibly faces unique economic and social challenges. Living in California, she may have varying views on state and national policies, particularly on topics such as immigration, education, and social welfare programs. Her economic situation and priorities may revolve around job stability, access to affordable healthcare, and quality education for her children. As a single parent, she may be concerned about the cost of living in California, childcare costs, and the overall well-being of her family. She may be open to policies supporting working-class families, affordable housing initiatives, and social services catering to single parents and immigrant communities. However, her specific stances on these issues would depend on her individual experiences and the needs of her household."
