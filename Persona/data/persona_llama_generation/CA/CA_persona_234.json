  "PERSONA": "A 35- to 44-year-old Hispanic or Latina female, born in Latin America, but a US citizen, living with her parents in California. She has a Bachelor's degree and speaks English well, in addition to an Asian and Pacific Islander language. Her educational background has likely led to better career prospects, but her household situation may indicate a non-traditional family structure. This could be due to various reasons such as cultural or economic factors. \n\nAs a child living with her parents at an older age, she may have a unique set of economic concerns, such as managing intergenerational financial responsibilities, saving for her own future, or navigating potential caregiving responsibilities for her aging parents. Her economic situation and priorities might be influenced by her household structure, education level, and job sector. Possible concerns or priorities for this demographic include affordable housing, education, and job opportunities, as well as access to healthcare and social services for her multigenerational household."
