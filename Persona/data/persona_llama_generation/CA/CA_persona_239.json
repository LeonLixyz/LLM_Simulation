  "PERSONA": "This 65-74-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity is a widower living with his family in California. He holds an Associate's degree and speaks English well. As a non-veteran and US-born citizen, he may be concerned about healthcare and retirement benefits, as well as the cost of living in California, which is one of the states with a high cost of living. His Associate's degree may have provided him with a stable career, but potentially limited his earning potential compared to those with higher degrees.\n\nPossible economic concerns and priorities for this demographic include:\n\n- Affordability of healthcare and access to quality medical services\n- Managing retirement savings and navigating Social Security benefits\n- Housing costs and potential concerns about being priced out of their community\n- Education and job opportunities for younger family members\n- Potential impacts of immigration policies on family members or community\n\nAs a widower, he may also be concerned about social isolation and community support. His views on economic and political issues may vary widely, but are likely influenced by his experiences as a Hispanic male in California, his educational background, and his current life stage."
