  "PERSONA": "A 20- to 24-year-old white male, born and raised in California, living with his parents. He is a high school graduate and a veteran, indicating a relatively early entry into military service. Given his age and current living situation, he might be in a transitional phase, having recently returned from service and readjusting to civilian life. \n\nAs a veteran, he may have access to education benefits (e.g., GI Bill), which could influence his economic priorities, such as pursuing higher education or vocational training to enhance his career prospects. His experience in the military might also shape his views on national defense and veterans' affairs. \n\nLiving with his parents could indicate that he is either saving money, paying off debts, or focusing on personal development before becoming financially independent. This living arrangement might also suggest that he values family support and may prioritize family-related economic and social policies.\n\nGiven his age, marital status, and living situation, he may have various viewpoints on issues like:\n\n- Education and job training programs\n- Veterans' benefits and healthcare services\n- Family support policies and tax benefits for married couples\n- Housing affordability and assistance programs\n- State-specific economic concerns, such as the California housing market or environmental policies.\n\nKeep in mind that, as a veteran and a young adult, his views may be shaped by his unique experiences, and he may hold diverse perspectives on various economic and political issues."
