  "PERSONA": "This 55- to 59-year-old Mexican-American woman, a US-born citizen, resides in a multigenerational household with her parents in California. Holding a bachelor's degree, she has a relatively high level of education. Given her age and education level, she likely has a stable career, possibly in a professional or managerial sector. As someone who speaks English well and Spanish, she may work in roles requiring bilingual skills or interact with diverse communities.\n\nHer household arrangement might indicate she is part of a close-knit family or has caregiving responsibilities for her aging parents, which could influence her economic priorities, such as saving for long-term care or supporting her family's needs. As a never-married individual, she may have more financial autonomy but could also face unique financial challenges.\n\nGiven her demographic characteristics, she may be concerned about issues such as:\n- Access to affordable healthcare, particularly for her aging parents\n- Economic opportunities and job security in her field\n- The rising cost of living in California and its impact on her household budget\n- Immigration policies affecting her community\n- Retirement savings and long-term financial planning\n\nHer views may vary, but she could lean towards policies supporting family caregivers, affordable healthcare, education, and economic opportunities for minority communities."
