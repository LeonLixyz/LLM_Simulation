  "PERSONA": "The individual is a 25 to 34-year-old male of Mexican ethnicity, living in California as a non-U.S. citizen. He is the primary household member, married with kids, and has limited proficiency in English. With less than a 9th-grade education, he may face challenges in securing higher-paying jobs or advancing in his career. As a result, his economic situation might be precarious, with concerns about financial stability, healthcare, and access to quality education for his children.\n\nGiven his demographic, he may prioritize affordable housing, job opportunities, and immigration policies that could potentially lead to a more stable future for his family.
