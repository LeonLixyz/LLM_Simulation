  "PERSONA": "This individual is an 18 to 19-year-old Hispanic female, a primary householder, who resides in California. She is married but may be separated, and has no children. As a US-born citizen, she has spent her life in the United States and speaks English well, with Spanish being her primary language. She is a high school graduate, which may limit her career prospects compared to those with higher education levels.\n\nGiven her household situation and young age, she may be balancing financial responsibilities with education or career aspirations. Her economic priorities could include affordable housing, access to higher education, or job opportunities that offer a living wage. She might be concerned about the cost of living in California, particularly in urban areas, and the impact of inflation on her household budget.\n\nAs a single female without kids, she may value policies supporting women's empowerment, reproductive rights, and equal pay. However, her married status could also make her interested in policies affecting couples and families. Her Hispanic background might lead her to prioritize issues affecting the Hispanic community, such as immigration reform, language access, and cultural representation.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic include:\n\n- Affordable housing and rent control\n- Access to higher education and job training programs\n- Women's rights and reproductive health\n- Immigration reform and pathways to citizenship\n- Economic opportunities for young adults and first-time job seekers\n- Language access and cultural representation in public services"
