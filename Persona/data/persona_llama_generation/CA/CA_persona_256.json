  "PERSONA": "A 65- to 74-year-old, US-born, Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity living in California. She is likely to be a married homeowner, possibly living with her spouse, and may have adult children who have moved out. As a high school graduate, her career prospects and income level may have been limited, leading to a modest retirement. Given her age and marital status, she might be receiving some form of retirement benefits, such as Social Security, which could be a key economic concern for her. \n\nShe may prioritize affordable healthcare and potential changes to Social Security or Medicare. Her household income could be relatively stable, with a mix of retirement benefits and possibly some part-time work. As a long-time resident of California, she may be concerned about the state's cost of living, housing affordability, and the economic implications of immigration policies on her community. Her English proficiency and US citizenship may also influence her views on language access and citizenship pathways.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns:\n\n- Affordable healthcare and potential changes to Medicare\n- Stability of Social Security benefits\n- Impact of immigration policies on her community\n- Housing affordability and cost of living in California\n- Access to education and job opportunities for younger generations\n- Language access and cultural preservation within the Hispanic community"
