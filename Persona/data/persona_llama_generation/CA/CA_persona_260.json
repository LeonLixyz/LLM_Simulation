  "PERSONA": "A 65- to 74-year-old white female living in California, likely retired or nearing retirement, with a graduate or professional degree. She is married, with her spouse being the household's primary decision-maker. As a US-born citizen who speaks English fluently, she has had access to quality education and has utilized it to secure better career prospects. \n\nHer high educational attainment suggests a higher lifetime income, potentially leading to homeownership and a more secure financial situation in retirement. However, she may still be concerned about the rising costs of living in California, particularly housing and healthcare costs, and how they might impact her and her spouse's retirement plans.\n\nGiven her age and educational background, she may prioritize issues such as:\n\n- Access to affordable healthcare, especially Medicare and Social Security\n- Tax policies that affect retirement savings and income\n- Housing affordability and availability for seniors\n- Education and job opportunities for younger generations, possibly her children or grandchildren\n- Environmental concerns and climate change mitigation efforts in California\n\nHer views may vary widely within these topics, ranging from conservative concerns about government spending and regulation to more liberal stances on social welfare and environmental protection."
