  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 35- to 44-year-old, US-born, Asian Indian woman who has never been married and lives with non-relatives. She is a high school graduate, speaks English well, and is a US citizen. As a resident of California, she likely faces a relatively high cost of living. Her non-relative housemate arrangement might indicate a shared living situation to split expenses, suggesting a potential concern about housing affordability. \n\nHer educational background as a high school graduate might limit her job prospects and earning potential compared to those with higher levels of education. As a result, she may be more concerned about job security, career advancement opportunities, and affordable access to further education or training. \n\nGiven her demographic, she might be part of the gig economy or work in service-oriented sectors, which can be subject to fluctuations in income and lack of benefits. She may prioritize policies addressing income inequality, affordable healthcare, and education or job training programs. She could also be concerned about transportation costs and access to affordable housing in California's competitive market.\n\nAs a never-married individual, she may not have the same family responsibilities as those with spouses or dependents, potentially allowing for more flexibility in her career choices or living situation. However, she may still face concerns about retirement savings, social security, and long-term financial stability.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns from this demographic might include:\n- Support for policies promoting affordable housing, education, and job training\n- Advocacy for workers' rights, especially in the gig economy\n- Concerns about healthcare access and affordability\n- Prioritization of public transportation and infrastructure development\n- Interest in policies addressing income inequality and wealth disparities\n- Potential skepticism about policies affecting her independence, such as marriage or family-related benefits"
