  "PERSONA": "This demographic represents a 35- to 44-year-old Asian male of Chinese ethnicity, living in California. He holds a bachelor's degree, indicating a higher level of education, which may have provided better career opportunities. However, he still resides with his parents, suggesting that he may be facing challenges in achieving financial independence or homeownership. His English proficiency and US citizenship likely facilitate his integration into the workforce and society.\n\nEconomically, this individual might be concerned about affordable housing, especially in a state like California, known for its high cost of living. He may prioritize policies that address housing affordability, job security, and career advancement opportunities. His experience living with his parents could make him more aware of the challenges faced by multigenerational households and potentially influence his views on social support systems and family-oriented policies.\n\nGiven his age and education, he may have diverse viewpoints on economic policies, ranging from supporting progressive taxation to advocating for reduced government intervention in the economy. His experience as a child living with his parents might also shape his opinions on family dynamics, social support systems, and the role of government in addressing these issues."
