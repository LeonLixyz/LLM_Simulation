  "PERSONA": "A 45-54-year-old white female who is a US-born citizen, resides in California, and holds a graduate or professional degree. She is a widow and lives with her parents, likely due to various reasons such as financial constraints, caregiving responsibilities, or personal preference. Her high level of education may have provided better job prospects and higher income potential, but her current household situation and marital status may impact her economic priorities. As a resident of California, she may be concerned about the state's high cost of living, housing affordability, and access to quality education and healthcare. Her economic concerns may include managing her household expenses, saving for retirement, and navigating the healthcare system as a widow.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns:\n\n- As a well-educated individual, she may prioritize policies that promote education and job opportunities, especially for women and widows.\n- She may be concerned about the affordability of healthcare, particularly for those with pre-existing conditions or those navigating the system alone.\n- Her experience living with her parents may make her more aware of the importance of eldercare and social support services.\n- As a resident of California, she may be concerned about the state's housing crisis, environmental policies, and the impact of climate change on local communities.\n- Her high level of education may make her more likely to engage with economic and political issues, and she may be interested in policies that promote economic growth, social welfare, and environmental sustainability."
