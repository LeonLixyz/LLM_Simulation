  "PERSONA": "The persona is a 35- to 44-year-old Korean female, living in a non-family household in California as a housemate or roomer. She is married but may be separated. As a US-born citizen with a high school diploma, she likely has a moderate level of economic stability. Her proficiency in English and additional knowledge of Spanish could provide her with more job opportunities in California's diverse job market. However, her educational background might limit her career prospects and earning potential compared to those with higher education levels. \n\nShe may have various economic concerns, such as saving for homeownership, managing household expenses with her non-relative housemates, and possibly supporting a family if she has children. As a married woman of Korean ethnicity, she may also be influenced by cultural expectations and family responsibilities. Her potential economic priorities might include affordable healthcare, education, and job opportunities. This demographic group may have diverse viewpoints on economic and political issues, ranging from supporting policies that promote affordable housing and education to advocating for policies that benefit small businesses and entrepreneurs."
