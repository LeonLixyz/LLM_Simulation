  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65- to 74-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States. She is the primary householder of a married-couple household with children. As a high school graduate, her educational background may have limited her career prospects, and she may have relied on her spouse's income or taken on lower-paying jobs to support her family. Her proficiency in English is limited, which could impact her ability to access certain economic opportunities or navigate complex government services.\n\nAs a resident of California, she may have concerns about the high cost of living, particularly housing costs and access to affordable healthcare. Her economic situation may be influenced by her age, with potential reliance on social security or pension plans. Her family structure, with children in the household, could mean she has responsibilities that extend beyond her own retirement needs, such as supporting adult children or grandchildren.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic might include:\n- Access to affordable healthcare and social services, particularly those catering to Spanish-speaking populations\n- Economic security in retirement, including the adequacy of social security benefits and pension plans\n- Housing affordability and the potential for intergenerational wealth transfer through homeownership\n- Education and job opportunities for her children and grandchildren, particularly in a state with a highly competitive job market\n- Language access and the availability of Spanish-language services in her community"
