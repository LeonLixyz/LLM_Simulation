  "PERSONA": "A 65- to 74-year-old White male living in California, residing with a relative, possibly due to financial constraints or a desire for companionship. Never married, this individual likely has limited family responsibilities but may still contribute to the household income or rely on a fixed income source. With some college education but no degree, his career prospects may have been limited, potentially affecting his current economic situation.\n\nPossible economic concerns or priorities for this demographic might include:\n\n- Financial stability in retirement, with reliance on a fixed income source\n- Healthcare costs and accessibility, particularly with increasing age\n- Housing affordability in California, where costs are relatively high\n- Potential reliance on social security benefits\n- Limited job opportunities or career advancement due to lack of a college degree\n\nGiven his residence with a relative and limited education, this individual may prioritize economic security and stability, possibly favoring policies that support fixed income sources, affordable housing, and accessible healthcare. However, as a non-veteran, he may not be directly impacted by or invested in veterans' affairs policies.\n\nAs a resident of California, he may also be concerned about state-specific issues such as wildfires, drought, and the high cost of living, potentially influencing his views on environmental policies and state-level economic decisions.\n\nWithin this demographic group, experiences may vary based on individual circumstances, such as the type of household relationship (e.g., sibling, parent, or other relative), the level of financial dependence, and personal health status. These factors can shape diverse viewpoints and priorities within this demographic."
