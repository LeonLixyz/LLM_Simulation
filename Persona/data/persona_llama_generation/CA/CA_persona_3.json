  "PERSONA": "A 35- to 44-year-old married White woman, born in the US, with a graduate or professional degree. She is a primary household member, residing in California with her spouse, and has no children. Her advanced education has led to a career as a sustainability consultant, likely in a private sector firm, contributing to a relatively stable income. As a resident of California, she may have concerns about environmental issues, such as climate change, and access to outdoor recreational activities. Her suburban location might lead to concerns about housing costs, transportation, and local community development. \n\nShe may prioritize policies related to environmental conservation, access to quality education, and women's rights. Her relatively stable economic situation may lead to a focus on long-term investments and retirement planning. Her volunteer work could indicate a concern for social causes, such as animal welfare. As a married couple without children, she may have more disposable income to allocate towards personal interests, such as yoga and hiking, and charitable causes. \n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns of this demographic group may include:\n- Environmental policies and climate change mitigation\n- Access to quality education and career opportunities\n- Women's rights and reproductive health\n- Affordable housing and suburban development\n- Retirement planning and financial security\n- Social causes, such as animal welfare and community development"
