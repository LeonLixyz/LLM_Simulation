  "PERSONA": "A 55- to 59-year-old, never-married, US-born Filipino woman living in a multigenerational household with her parents in California. She has a high school diploma and speaks English well, but may also be proficient in Tagalog or another Filipino language. Her living situation may indicate a sense of family responsibility and cultural closeness. Given her age and education, she might be employed in a lower- to middle-income job, possibly in the service sector. Economic concerns could include healthcare access, caregiving responsibilities for her aging parents, and housing costs in California. She may prioritize job security, affordable healthcare, and social support for seniors. Her views on politics and the economy might be influenced by her experiences as a child of immigrants, her multigenerational household, and her observations of California's diverse communities."
