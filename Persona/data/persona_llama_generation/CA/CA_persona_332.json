  "PERSONA": "A 45- to 54-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States and a resident of California. As the primary householder, she lives alone and has never been married. With less than a 9th-grade education, her career prospects may be limited, and she may face challenges in securing higher-paying jobs. Her proficiency in English, however, is an advantage in the workforce.\n\nHer economic situation is likely precarious, with limited financial resources and potential difficulties in achieving homeownership. She may rely on public assistance or low-wage jobs to make ends meet. As a single individual without dependents, her financial priorities may focus on personal stability and security.\n\nGiven her demographic background, she may be concerned about issues such as:\n\n* Access to affordable education and job training programs to improve her career prospects\n* Healthcare and social services, particularly those catering to low-income individuals\n* Immigration policies and their impact on her community, despite being a US-born citizen herself\n* Economic inequality and opportunities for social mobility\n* Local and state-level policies affecting housing affordability and cost of living in California\n\nHer viewpoints may vary, but she may be more likely to support policies that address income inequality, education, and healthcare access. However, her opinions on specific issues may differ depending on her personal experiences and values."
