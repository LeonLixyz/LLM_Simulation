  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 25-34-year-old US-born Asian Indian male who resides in California. He lives in a multigenerational or other non-traditional household, likely with relatives, and has never been married. With a high school diploma, his educational background may limit his job prospects and career advancement opportunities. As a non-veteran, he does not have access to exclusive veteran benefits. Despite primarily speaking Spanish at home, he speaks English well, which is beneficial for navigating everyday life and the job market in California. Given his age and marital status, he may be prioritizing career development, financial stability, and independence. His economic concerns might include affordable housing, education or job training opportunities, and access to healthcare. As a resident of California, he may also be interested in policies addressing the state's high cost of living, environmental issues, and immigration reform. He may hold diverse views on these topics, ranging from supporting increased government intervention in the economy to advocating for individual freedom and limited government regulation."
