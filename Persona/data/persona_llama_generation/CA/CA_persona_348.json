  "PERSONA": "This persona is an 18 to 19-year-old, unmarried, white female who identifies as having some other race. She lives alone in California and is the primary household decision-maker. With less than a 9th-grade education, her job prospects may be limited, and she might face challenges in achieving economic stability. As a result, she could be concerned about access to affordable education or vocational training to improve her career opportunities.\n\nGiven her age and limited education, she may be more likely to be employed in the service industry or other low-wage sectors, which could make her susceptible to economic fluctuations and policy changes affecting minimum wage, workers' rights, or job security. Living in California, one of the states with a high cost of living, she might also be concerned about affordable housing, healthcare, and the overall cost of living.\n\nHer lack of higher education may not necessarily determine her views on education policy, as she might recognize the importance of education for future generations and support initiatives that make quality education more accessible. However, her personal experiences might make her more inclined to support policies addressing immediate economic needs, such as affordable housing or job training programs.\n\nAs a young, unmarried woman, she may also be interested in reproductive rights, access to healthcare, and policies affecting women's empowerment. Her views on these topics might be shaped by her personal circumstances, such as the need for affordable healthcare or the impact of economic policies on her independence.\n\nThis persona may hold diverse views within the spectrum of economic and political policies, influenced by her unique experiences as a young, low-educated, female household decision-maker living in a high-cost state."
