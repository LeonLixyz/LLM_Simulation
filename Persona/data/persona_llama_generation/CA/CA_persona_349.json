  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 55-59-year-old, white male of some other race, born in the United States, and a US citizen. He resides in California and speaks English fluently. He has a bachelor's degree, which likely opened up various job opportunities. However, he has never been married and still lives with his parents. This living arrangement might impact his economic situation, as he may not have the same level of financial independence as others his age. His concerns and priorities could revolve around long-term care for his parents, potential inheritance, and his own financial security. He may prioritize policies that address affordable housing, healthcare, and social security. He could also be interested in tax policies and pension plans. His economic views might lean towards liberal or conservative, depending on his career and individual experiences."
