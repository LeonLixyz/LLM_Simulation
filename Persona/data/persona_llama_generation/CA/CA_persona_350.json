  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 35- to 44-year-old male of Mexican ethnicity, living in California with limited English proficiency. He is married and likely part of a household with a spouse who may be the primary breadwinner or decision-maker. As a non-U.S. citizen with a high school diploma, his job prospects might be limited to lower-skilled or manual labor positions, which could impact his economic situation and access to resources.\n\nHis household income may be lower to moderate, and homeownership might be a challenge due to limited job opportunities, language barriers, and possibly lower earning potential. Given his limited English proficiency, he may face difficulties navigating the U.S. economy, accessing healthcare, and interacting with institutions.\n\nAs a non-citizen, he may have concerns about immigration policies, access to healthcare, and social services. His economic priorities might include job security, affordable housing, and access to education or job training programs that can improve his career prospects.\n\nHe may also be interested in policies that support immigrant communities, such as language assistance programs, cultural adaptation services, and pathways to citizenship. His viewpoints on economic and political issues may vary, but he is likely to prioritize policies that benefit his family, improve his economic situation, and provide greater stability and security."
