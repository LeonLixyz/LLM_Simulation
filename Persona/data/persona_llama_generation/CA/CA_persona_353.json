  "PERSONA": "This persona represents a 75- to 84-year-old foreign-born female, originally from Latin America, who is married and lives with her spouse in California. She has a high school diploma and speaks Spanish as her primary language, but is also proficient in English. \n\nGiven her age, she is likely retired or semi-retired, which might place her in a fixed income situation, potentially reliant on savings, social security, or a pension. Her economic concerns might revolve around healthcare costs, affordable housing, and maintaining her standard of living on a limited income. As a non-U.S. citizen, she may face unique challenges accessing certain government services or benefits.\n\nHer Latin American background and Spanish language proficiency suggest she might be part of a close-knit ethnic community, which could influence her social network and information sources. This, in turn, may shape her views on immigration policies, social services, and cultural preservation.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic might include:\n- Access to affordable healthcare, particularly for seniors\n- Immigration reform and pathways to citizenship\n- Social security and pension stability\n- Cultural preservation and community support for Latin American immigrants\n- Affordable housing options for seniors\n- Language access and inclusivity in government services\n\nThis persona represents a diverse range of experiences, including the challenges of aging, immigration, and language barriers, which can inform economic and political policy responses."
