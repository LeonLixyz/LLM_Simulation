  "PERSONA": "This individual is an 85-year-old male of Mexican ethnicity, born in Mexico but now a US citizen. He holds a bachelor's degree and speaks English well. He resides in California, likely in an urban area, given the state's demographics. As a widower and primary householder, he may live with family members, possibly adult children or grandchildren, in a multigenerational household. His advanced age and education level suggest he may be retired, with a fixed income and access to social security benefits. He may have economic concerns related to healthcare, retirement savings, and supporting his family members. Given his age and life experience, he might prioritize policies related to elder care, pension security, and affordable healthcare. His views on immigration policies might be influenced by his own experience as a foreign-born US citizen. As a Californian, he may be exposed to and influenced by the state's progressive policies, but his individual views could vary widely."
