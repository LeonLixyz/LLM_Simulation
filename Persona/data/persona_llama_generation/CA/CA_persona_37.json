  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 35- to 44-year-old male who lives in California with his spouse. Born in Latin America, he is not a U.S. citizen but speaks English well. He has a high school diploma and is likely to be in the workforce, possibly in an entry- to mid-level position given his education. As a non-citizen, he may face certain restrictions or challenges in the job market and access to benefits, which could influence his economic concerns.\n\nGiven his marital status and age, he may have family responsibilities, including potentially raising children, which could impact his economic priorities, such as seeking stable employment, affordable healthcare, and education for his family. His household income might be moderate, given his educational background and the fact that he lives in California, a state known for a relatively high cost of living.\n\nPossible economic concerns or priorities for this demographic include:\n- Access to affordable healthcare and health insurance\n- Job security and career advancement opportunities\n- Education and future prospects for his children\n- Immigration and citizenship status, which could affect his long-term economic stability and access to benefits\n- Housing affordability in California, considering the state's high cost of living\n\nHis viewpoints on economic and political policies could vary widely based on his experiences as a non-citizen living in the United States, his family responsibilities, and his economic situation. He might prioritize policies that support immigrant rights, affordable living, and access to education and healthcare, while also considering the broader economic implications of such policies on his family's future."
