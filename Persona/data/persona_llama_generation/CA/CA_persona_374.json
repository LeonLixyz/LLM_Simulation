  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 60- to 64-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity living in California. As a high school graduate and the primary householder of a single-person household, he may have limited financial resources, potentially relying on retirement or a fixed income. His English proficiency is limited, which could impact his access to information and participation in the economy. \n\nAs a divorced individual without children, his household expenses are lower compared to those with dependents, but he may still face financial challenges related to healthcare, housing, and other living costs in California, which has a high cost of living. His economic concerns might include managing retirement savings, accessing affordable healthcare, and dealing with the financial implications of being a single household. He may prioritize policies supporting affordable housing, social security, and accessible healthcare services.\n\nGiven his demographic background, he may also be interested in policies affecting the Hispanic community, such as immigration reform, language access, and cultural preservation. However, his views on these topics may vary, as individual perspectives within the demographic group can differ."
