  "PERSONA": "A 60- to 64-year-old, US-born, White female who resides in California. She is separated and lives with her parents, possibly due to economic necessity, caregiving responsibilities, or personal reasons. Holding a bachelor's degree, her educational background indicates potential for a stable career; however, her current living situation may suggest a change in economic circumstances or life priorities.\n\nGiven her proficiency in Spanish and limited English skills, she may face specific challenges in the job market or social services, particularly in a state like California where English is predominantly spoken. As a non-veteran, she does not have access to exclusive veteran benefits.\n\nHer primary economic concerns might revolve around:\n\n- Navigating the healthcare system and accessing age-related services\n- Managing living expenses, potentially relying on her parents for financial support\n- Job opportunities or career growth, considering her language barrier and age\n- Balancing personal independence with the need for support from her family\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic include:\n\n- Advocacy for improved language access in public services and healthcare\n- Support for policies addressing ageism in the job market\n- Concerns about affordable housing, especially in a state with a high cost of living like California\n- Prioritization of social security, pension, or retirement benefits\n- Interest in local initiatives that promote intergenerational family support and caregiving resources"
