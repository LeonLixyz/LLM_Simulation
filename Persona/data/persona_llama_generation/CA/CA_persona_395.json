Despite being a non-U.S. citizen, born in Latin America, he speaks English well, and has achieved a graduate or professional degree. His high level of education likely contributes to a higher socioeconomic status within his community.\n\nAs a non-citizen, he may face challenges related to employment and access to certain government services.
