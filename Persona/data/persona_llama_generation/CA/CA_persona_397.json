  "PERSONA": "A 20-24 year old, US-born, white female who resides in California, speaks Spanish and English, and has less than a 9th-grade education. She is a non-relative housemate, indicating that she shares a living space with others but is not part of a family unit or couple. Her marital status is listed as widowed, but given her age, this might be an error or an unusual circumstance.\n\nThis individual's low level of education may limit her job prospects and earning potential, leading to concerns about economic stability and access to resources. She may prioritize affordable education or job training programs, as well as policies that support low-income households. Her proficiency in Spanish suggests she may be part of the Hispanic community in California, which could influence her views on immigration and cultural issues. However, her white racial identity may also shape her experiences and perspectives.\n\nAs a young adult, she may be concerned about issues like student loan debt, affordable housing, and access to healthcare. Her non-relative housemate status could indicate that she values independence and flexibility, but may also face challenges related to housing security and social support networks. Given her circumstances, she may be interested in policies that address income inequality, education, and social welfare programs."
