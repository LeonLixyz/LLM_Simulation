  "PERSONA": "This persona represents a 25- to 34-year-old Hispanic female who lives with her parents in California. As a high school graduate and a veteran, she has likely developed a strong sense of discipline and responsibility. Her marital status as divorced may indicate potential challenges with financial stability or childcare responsibilities. \n\nGiven her multi-generational household type, she may have access to a support system but also face limitations in personal space and independence. Her English proficiency and being US-born may provide her with more job opportunities compared to non-English speakers or non-citizens. However, her education level might limit her career prospects and earning potential in a competitive job market like California.\n\nHer economic concerns might revolve around finding stable employment, managing debt (if any), and potentially saving for further education or a place of her own. She may prioritize affordable housing, healthcare, and education policies that cater to her situation as a single parent or a veteran. Her political views could range from supporting social welfare programs and labor rights to advocating for education reform and veteran benefits."
