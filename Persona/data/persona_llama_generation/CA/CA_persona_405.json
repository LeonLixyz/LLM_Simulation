  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 35- to 44-year-old white female, living in California, who has been divorced and holds a graduate or professional degree. As the spouse of the household, she may not be the primary income earner, but her education level suggests she has a high earning potential and contributes significantly to the household income. Her English proficiency and US citizenship indicate that she is likely well-integrated into the local community and economy.\n\nGiven her educational background, she may have a career in a high-paying sector such as law, medicine, or academia. However, being divorced, she may have experienced financial instability and could be concerned about economic security, especially if she has dependents. She may prioritize policies that support single parents, education, and career development.\n\nHer location in California, an urban and economically diverse state, means she may be exposed to a wide range of economic and social issues, influencing her views on topics such as housing affordability, education funding, and social welfare programs. She may also be concerned about environmental policies, given California's focus on environmental protection.\n\nAs a member of a household with a potentially complex family structure, she may hold diverse views on topics like family leave policies, childcare support, and healthcare access. Her graduate education may also make her more likely to engage in civic activities and be informed about local and national politics, leading to a more nuanced understanding of economic and political issues."
