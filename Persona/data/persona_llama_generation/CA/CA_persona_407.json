  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65- to 74-year-old, foreign-born, non-U.S. citizen male from Asia, residing in California. As the primary householder of a single-person household, he has no dependents and has never been married. He speaks English well, despite not being born in the United States, and has some college education without a degree. \n\nHis economic situation might be influenced by his limited education and potentially lower earning potential, but he may have established a stable career in a sector that doesn't require a degree. As a non-citizen, he may face certain restrictions or challenges in accessing social services, healthcare, and other benefits, which could impact his economic security.\n\nGiven his age, this individual may be nearing or already in retirement, relying on personal savings, pension, or part-time work for income. Homeownership is uncertain, but as a long-term resident of California, he may have benefited from the state's rising property values if he owns a home.\n\nHis views on economic policies might prioritize affordable healthcare, particularly for non-citizens, and potentially more accessible pathways to citizenship. He may also be concerned with pension and retirement security, as well as the cost of living in California, which has a notoriously high cost of living index. He could be supportive of policies that address these concerns, but his views may vary based on his individual experiences and values.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns of this demographic might include:\n- Access to affordable healthcare and social services as a non-citizen\n- Pathways to citizenship or improved rights for long-term residents\n- Retirement security and pension stability\n- Affordable housing options in high-cost areas like California\n- Potential impacts of immigration policies on his personal life and community"
