  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 60- to 64-year-old Hispanic male living in California, likely in a multigenerational household with his parents. His limited education (less than 9th grade) may have impacted his career prospects and current economic situation. Given his age, he is likely retired or nearing retirement, possibly relying on a fixed income. His English proficiency and birthplace in the US suggest he may have been raised in an English-speaking environment, potentially influencing his access to information and opportunities. Living in California, one of the more expensive states, could pose economic concerns, such as housing affordability and healthcare costs. As a never-married individual, he may have fewer family responsibilities but could be more vulnerable to economic shocks. His views on economic policies might prioritize affordable living, social security, and healthcare, while his opinions on education may emphasize vocational training or second-chance programs. His limited education may also make him more skeptical of complex policy proposals or less likely to engage in detailed discussions on certain topics."
