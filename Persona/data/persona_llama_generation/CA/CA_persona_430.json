He is married, but due to still residing with his parents, may be navigating shared household responsibilities and financial obligations. With a graduate or professional degree, he likely has a relatively high level of education, which can influence his career prospects and economic situation. \n\nGiven his educational background, he might be employed in a professional or specialized sector, potentially earning a middle to upper-middle-class income. However, his decision to live with his parents could be a strategic choice to save on living expenses, pay off student loans, or support his family financially.\n\nAs a US-born citizen who speaks English well, language barriers are unlikely to impact his job opportunities or civic engagement.
