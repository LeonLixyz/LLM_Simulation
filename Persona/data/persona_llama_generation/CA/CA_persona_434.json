  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65- to 74-year-old male, who identifies as White and Some Other Race, and was born in Asia. As a foreign-born non-citizen, his immigration status might significantly influence his economic and political views.

Being divorced, he may not have the financial responsibilities of raising children but could potentially be supporting former family members or have alimony obligations.\n\nLiving in California, one of the states with the highest costs of living in the United States, this individual may be concerned about the affordability of housing, healthcare, and other living expenses, particularly in retirement. His higher education level might also make him more aware of and invested in policies related to education and social services.\n\nGiven his background and circumstances, this individual might be interested in policies affecting:\n\n1. Immigration reform and pathways to citizenship\n2. Affordable healthcare options for seniors and non-citizens\n3. Education and social services, particularly for older adults\n4. Housing affordability and senior living arrangements\n5. Tax policies and retirement planning for non-citizens\n6. Economic opportunities and job market access for older, educated workers\n\nAs a foreign-born, highly educated individual, he may have diverse perspectives on these issues, ranging from concerns about social integration and access to services to interests in economic growth and development. His views could also be influenced by his experiences as a non-citizen and a divorced individual."
