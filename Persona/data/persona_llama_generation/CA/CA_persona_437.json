  "PERSONA": "A 60-64-year-old Mexican-American woman, born in Latin America, and now a US citizen, living in California with her spouse. She holds a bachelor's degree and is the primary householder. Her proficiency in English is limited, which might impact her job prospects or interactions with English-dominated services. As a married couple without kids, they may have more disposable income, but also face the challenges of aging and potential healthcare concerns without a younger support system. Given her age, she may be nearing or in retirement, and her economic concerns could include healthcare costs, social security, and pension plans. Her education level and potentially limited English proficiency might influence her views on immigration policies, education, and economic opportunities for underrepresented groups. She might value policies that support older adults, promote bilingual services, and address healthcare access. However, her individual experiences and perspectives may vary, and she may prioritize issues like environmental protection, economic growth, or law enforcement, depending on her personal circumstances and values."
