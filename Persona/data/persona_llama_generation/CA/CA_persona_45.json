  "PERSONA": "A 38-year-old married Hispanic woman, born in Latin America, and a US citizen, residing in California with her spouse. She holds a Bachelor's degree and is proficient in English. As a spouse of the household, her economic situation is likely tied to her partner's income, potentially in the middle to upper-middle-class range given her educational background. Her job sector and income level are uncertain, but she may be working in a professional field.\n\nHer educational background has likely provided her with better career prospects, but may also come with student loan debt. As a spouse, she may have shared financial responsibilities, including a mortgage if they are homeowners, which could be a significant expense in California's competitive housing market.\n\nLiving in California, she may have concerns about the high cost of living, housing affordability, and access to quality education for any future children.
