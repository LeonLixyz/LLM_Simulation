  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65- to 74-year-old male, born in Latin America, and is a non-U.S. citizen. He is the primary householder of a single-person household and is married, but his spouse may not be living with him. He holds a graduate or professional degree, indicating a high level of education. However, his English proficiency is limited, as he speaks English less than very well, and his primary language is Spanish.\n\nGiven his age, he is likely in retirement or nearing retirement. As a non-U.S. citizen, he may have limited access to certain social security benefits or government assistance programs, which could be a concern for him. His advanced education and professional background may have provided him with a relatively stable financial situation, but his limited English proficiency could impact his ability to navigate the U.S. healthcare system or access certain services.\n\nAs a resident of California, he may be influenced by the state's diverse economy, cultural landscape, and politics. He may be concerned about issues related to immigration, healthcare, and social security, as well as access to education and job opportunities for himself or his family members. His experience as a foreign-born individual may also shape his views on U.S. foreign policy and international relations.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns:\n\n* Immigration reform and pathways to citizenship\n* Access to healthcare and social services for non-U.S. citizens\n* Economic security and stability in retirement\n* Language access and barriers to services\n* Education and job opportunities for himself or family members\n* U.S. foreign policy and its impact on Latin America\n\nThis persona represents a unique intersection of demographic characteristics, highlighting the complexities and challenges faced by older, foreign-born individuals with limited English proficiency living in the United States."
