  "PERSONA": "This persona is a 55- to 59-year-old US-born Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, who has been married and resides in a family household in California. She is a high school graduate and may face potential language barriers due to speaking English less than very well. Her proficiency in English might limit her job prospects and access to certain economic opportunities. \n\nGiven her age and marital status, she might have adult children who have moved out of the household, but still may have some family responsibilities. As a spouse of the household, her economic situation could be influenced by her partner's income and job sector. \n\nPossible economic concerns for this demographic include access to affordable healthcare, particularly in older age, the impact of potential language barriers on job opportunities, and retirement savings. She may prioritize economic policies that support working-class families, language access programs, and affordable healthcare options for seniors. Her views on economic policies might be shaped by her experiences as a Hispanic woman in California and the economic implications of living in an urban or suburban area of the state."
