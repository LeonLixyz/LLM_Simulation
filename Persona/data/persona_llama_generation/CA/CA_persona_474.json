  "PERSONA": "A 75- to 84-year-old married but separated female, born in the US, resides in California as the primary householder of a single-person household. She holds a graduate or professional degree and speaks English well, with Spanish as her primary language. This demographic likely values stability and has a strong educational foundation, which may have provided her with better career prospects and financial security.\n\nGiven her age, she may be retired or nearing retirement, with a focus on healthcare, social security, and pension. Her household income could be a combination of retirement benefits, investments, and potentially part-time work.
