  "PERSONA": "A 45- to 54-year-old, non-Hispanic, white female living in California. She holds a bachelor's degree, which likely contributes to her employment in a white-collar profession, possibly in fields like education, healthcare, or management. As a non-relative housemate, she may be sharing living expenses with others, which can help manage costs in an expensive state like California. \n\nGiven her educational background, she might have a moderate to high income level, potentially between $60,000 and $120,000 per year. As a never-married individual, she may not have the financial responsibilities associated with raising a family, but could be supporting other dependents or have significant personal financial goals, such as saving for retirement or paying off student loans.\n\nHer primary concerns may revolve around affordable housing, healthcare, and education. As a resident of California, she might be impacted by the state's housing crisis and could be in favor of policies addressing housing affordability. Her views on education policy could be influenced by her own educational background and the value she places on higher education.\n\nShe might also prioritize environmental policies, given California's emphasis on sustainability and her potential exposure to the state's environmental concerns, such as droughts and wildfires. As a US-born citizen with a bachelor's degree, she may have a strong sense of civic engagement and participate in local politics."
