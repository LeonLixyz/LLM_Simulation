  "PERSONA": "A 55- to 59-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity living in California. He is homeless, separated, and has some college education but no degree. Born in Mexico, he is a US citizen and speaks Spanish as his primary language but is also proficient in English. Given his background, he may face challenges related to affordable housing, employment opportunities, and healthcare access. His experiences as a homeless individual may lead him to prioritize policies addressing poverty, affordable housing, and social services. As a separated individual, he may also be concerned about family law and child support policies. His educational background may limit his job prospects, making him more likely to support policies promoting vocational training and education. Living in California, he may be aware of the state's economic growth and the widening wealth gap, potentially influencing his views on taxation, minimum wage, and workers' rights. His proficiency in English may also make him more likely to engage with the political process and access information, but his homelessness may limit his ability to participate in certain civic activities."
