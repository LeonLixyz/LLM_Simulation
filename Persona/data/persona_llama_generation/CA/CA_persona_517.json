  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65- to 74-year-old, foreign-born, Asian female, who is a US citizen. She holds a Bachelor's degree and is proficient in English, but her primary language at home is Spanish. She is separated and lives in a married-couple household without children. As the primary householder, she is likely to be responsible for household financial decisions. Given her age, she may be retired or nearing retirement, which could influence her economic concerns, such as access to affordable healthcare, social security benefits, and retirement savings.

Possible concerns or viewpoints include:\n\n- Healthcare access and affordability, particularly for seniors\n- Immigration reform and policies affecting foreign-born citizens\n- Retirement security and social safety nets\n- State and national economic policies impacting the cost of living in California\n- Potential interest in education and job training programs for immigrants or seniors looking to re-enter the workforce"
