  "PERSONA": "A 65- to 74-year-old, married, US citizen woman of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, living in California. She holds a graduate or professional degree, indicating a high level of education, which likely contributed to her career prospects and current economic situation. As a homeowner in California, she may have significant equity in her property but also faces the challenges of the state's high cost of living. Her advanced age might lead to concerns about retirement, healthcare, and long-term care. She could be worried about Social Security, pension, or retirement savings, and potential policy changes affecting these programs. As someone who has navigated the US education system and achieved a high level of success, she may value policies that support education and career development. Her experience as an immigrant might make her sympathetic to immigration reform and policies that support the Latin American community. She could hold a range of viewpoints on issues such as taxation, healthcare reform, and social welfare programs, depending on her individual circumstances and values."
