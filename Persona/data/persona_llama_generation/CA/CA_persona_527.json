  "PERSONA": "This persona represents a 35- to 44-year-old, multiracial female (White and Black or African American) who is the primary household holder in a childless, married-couple household in California. She holds a graduate or professional degree, which likely provides her with a higher earning potential. \n\nAs a non-U.S. citizen, originally from Latin America, she might face unique challenges related to immigration status, such as navigating the pathway to citizenship or dealing with potential biases. Her ability to speak English well may mitigate some of these challenges, particularly in the job market. However, she may still face cultural or language barriers outside of work.\n\nHer household type (married-couple without kids) and education level suggest that she and her partner may have a relatively high combined income. However, as a non-U.S. citizen, she may have limited access to certain benefits or government assistance programs. \n\nPotential economic concerns or priorities for this demographic might include:\n- Immigration reform and pathway to citizenship\n- Access to affordable healthcare and education\n- Job opportunities and career advancement\n- Homeownership and affordable housing\n- Retirement planning and social security benefits\n- Taxation policies and their impact on dual-income households\n\nPossible viewpoints within this demographic group:\n- Support for policies promoting immigration reform and increased access to citizenship\n- Advocacy for increased funding for education and job training programs\n- Concerns about the impact of economic policies on dual-income households\n- Prioritization of affordable housing and healthcare initiatives\n- Diverse perspectives on taxation policies and their impact on non-U.S. citizens"
