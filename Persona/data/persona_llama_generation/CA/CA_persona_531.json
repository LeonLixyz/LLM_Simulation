  "PERSONA": "A 25- to 34-year-old Hispanic or Latino male, born and raised in California, lives with his parents in a multi-generational household. He is married but may be experiencing marital separation. Having only completed high school, his career prospects may be limited, and he might be pursuing vocational training or further education to improve his economic situation. His proficiency in English, despite Spanish being his primary language, is an asset in the job market, especially in a culturally diverse state like California. He may work in service industries, such as hospitality or retail, where language skills are valuable. \n\nEconomic concerns for this demographic might include affordable housing, access to higher education or vocational training, and job security. As a resident of California, he may be particularly aware of the state's high cost of living and the challenges it poses to first-time homebuyers or those seeking to start a family. His experiences living with his parents could also make him more conscious of intergenerational economic dynamics and the role of family support in achieving financial stability. \n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns from this demographic could range from advocating for policies that support affordable housing, education, and job training, to expressing concerns about the impact of immigration policies on his community and the need for more inclusive economic opportunities."
