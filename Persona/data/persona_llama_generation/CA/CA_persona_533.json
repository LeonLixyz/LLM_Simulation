She has an associate's degree, which may have contributed to her career prospects and earning potential, although her current homeless status suggests significant economic challenges.\n\nHer educational background and age suggest she may have had a working life that spanned multiple industries and sectors, possibly with varying levels of job security and income.

Affordable housing and senior housing initiatives\n2. Access to quality, affordable healthcare for seniors\n3. Economic support programs for low-income seniors\n4. Immigration policies and their impact on her community\n5. Education and job training initiatives for older workers\n\nHer experiences as a divorced, homeless senior may lead her to prioritize policies addressing economic insecurity, housing, and social services. However, her opinions on these topics can vary widely, reflecting the diversity within her demographic group."
