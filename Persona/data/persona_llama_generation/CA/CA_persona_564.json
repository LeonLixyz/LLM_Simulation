  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65- to 74-year-old Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity, living in California with her spouse. Given her age, she is likely retired or nearing retirement, with a potential reliance on Social Security benefits or retirement savings. Her educational background, with some high school education but no diploma, may have limited her career prospects and earning potential throughout her life. As a non-citizen, she might face challenges accessing certain social services or benefits, which could influence her economic priorities and views on immigration policies.\n\nGiven her long-term residence in the United States, she likely has strong ties to her community and may have family members who are U.S. citizens. Her experience as a non-citizen could shape her perspectives on immigration reform, with possible concerns about pathways to citizenship, access to healthcare, and economic opportunities for immigrants.\n\nAs a resident of California, she may be exposed to a diverse range of cultures and socioeconomic realities, influencing her views on social and economic policies. Her age and marital status might also make her more concerned with healthcare access, affordable housing, and retirement security. She may hold a range of viewpoints on these issues, from supporting expanded social services to advocating for more restrictive immigration policies, reflecting the diversity of experiences within her demographic group."
