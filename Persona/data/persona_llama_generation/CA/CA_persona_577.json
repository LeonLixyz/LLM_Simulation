  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 75- to 84-year-old, US-born, African American female who is a primary householder in California. Given her age, it is likely she is living alone without kids. As a high school graduate, she may have had limited career prospects and thus may have lower income levels, potentially relying on social security or pension for financial support. Her proficiency in English and Spanish may have been an asset in her professional life, but her job opportunities may have been restricted by her education level. \n\nShe may have concerns about healthcare access and affordability, especially given her age and the rising costs of healthcare in the US. She might prioritize affordable housing options, as California is known for being expensive, and may be concerned about maintaining homeownership or finding suitable living arrangements as she ages. Given her background and age, she may be interested in policies that protect social security, pension plans, and affordable healthcare options for seniors. Her experience as a single, never-married woman may also lead her to value policies supporting independent living and senior care services."
