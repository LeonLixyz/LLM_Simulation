  "PERSONA": "A 62-year-old, US-born Mexican woman, who is the primary householder of a married-couple household with kids. She has some college education but no degree and has been married for over 40 years. Her proficiency in English is limited, preferring to communicate in Spanish. As a result, she may face challenges navigating English-dominated systems, such as healthcare, education, or government services.\n\nGiven her age, she may be nearing or already in retirement, with concerns about Social Security, pension, and healthcare. Her family structure, with grown children, may influence her priorities, such as ensuring her children's financial stability and planning for their future. As a long-time resident of California, she may be familiar with the state's policies and may have strong opinions on issues like immigration, education, and healthcare.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns:\n- Healthcare access and affordability, particularly for those with limited English proficiency\n- Education policies affecting her children and grandchildren\n- Immigration policies and their impact on the Hispanic community\n- Economic security in retirement, including Social Security and pension\n- Preservation of Mexican heritage and cultural traditions within her family and community"
