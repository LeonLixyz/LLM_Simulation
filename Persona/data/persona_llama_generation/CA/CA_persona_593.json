  "PERSONA": "This persona is a 65 to 74-year-old white, married female living in California, primarily heading a household with her spouse and no children. She is a US-born citizen, speaks English fluently, and has a high school diploma. Given her age and marital status, she is likely to be retired or nearing retirement, with a focus on managing her household expenses, healthcare, and retirement savings. Her high school education may limit her career prospects, but she has likely had a stable income and lifestyle throughout her life. Living in California, she may be concerned about the high cost of living, access to quality healthcare, and the state's economic policies affecting her retirement benefits. She may prioritize issues like Social Security, Medicare, and pension plans, as well as local concerns such as housing affordability and transportation. Her views on economic and political issues could range from conservative (focusing on preserving her retirement security) to moderate (seeking a balance between economic growth and social welfare), depending on her personal experiences and values."
