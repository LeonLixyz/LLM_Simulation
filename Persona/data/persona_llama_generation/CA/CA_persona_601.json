  "PERSONA": "This demographic represents a 35-44-year-old, US-born, white female living in California. Despite being an adult, she resides in a multi-generational household with her parents, which might indicate financial constraints or cultural preferences. She holds a bachelor's degree, but her English proficiency is limited, as she speaks English less than very well and her primary language is an Asian or Pacific Islander language. This could present challenges in career advancement and social integration.\n\nGiven her educational background, she may be employed in a professional or semi-professional sector, possibly in a field that does not require advanced English proficiency or has a high demand for linguistic diversity. However, her limited English skills might limit her job prospects and career growth.\n\nAs a never-married individual, she might prioritize financial stability and independence. Her concerns could revolve around affordable housing, access to quality education and job training programs, and social services catering to linguistically diverse populations. She might also be interested in policies addressing the challenges faced by multi-generational households and the elderly.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns within this demographic group include:\n\n- Support for affordable housing initiatives and subsidies for multi-generational households\n- Advocacy for language-accessible public services and job training programs\n- Interest in education policies promoting linguistic diversity and cultural sensitivity\n- Prioritization of healthcare and social services for elderly family members\n- Concerns about economic opportunities and career advancement for individuals with limited English proficiency"
