  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 55- to 59-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity living in California. She is married and resides with her spouse, suggesting a stable household structure. As a high school graduate, her educational background indicates she may have limited access to high-paying jobs, potentially affecting her economic situation. Given her age, she may be nearing or in the early stages of retirement, which could influence her economic concerns, such as social security, pension, or retirement savings.\n\nHer household income might be influenced by her spouse's job sector, with potential implications on healthcare, mortgage or rent payments, and savings for retirement. As a US-born citizen who speaks English well, language barriers are unlikely to hinder her economic prospects or access to information. However, her ethnic background and geographic location in California, a state with a diverse economy and high cost of living, might shape her economic priorities.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns this demographic might have include:\n- Affordability of healthcare and long-term care\n- Economic security in retirement\n- Support for policies addressing income inequality and access to education for future generations\n- Interest in state and local policies affecting housing costs and availability in California\n- Diverse views on immigration policies, given her Mexican ethnicity and US birth, possibly empathizing with both the importance of border security and the need for a compassionate immigration system."
