  "PERSONA": "This 60- to 64-year-old female, foreign-born from Asia, lives in California as a non-U.S. citizen. As the primary householder in a married-couple household without kids, she is separated but still lives with her spouse. She speaks English well, despite potentially having limited proficiency in other areas due to her less than 9th-grade education level. Her limited education might restrict her job opportunities and income level. Given her age, she might be nearing or already in retirement, relying on limited savings or a fixed income.\n\nHer household type and location in California could imply a relatively high cost of living. As a non-citizen, she may face challenges accessing certain government benefits, which could impact her economic security. Her marital status and household situation could also affect her economic priorities, with a focus on financial stability and independence.\n\nPossible economic concerns or priorities for this demographic include:\n\n- Access to affordable healthcare and social services, given her limited education and potential language barriers.\n- Financial security in retirement, with limited job opportunities and potential reliance on a fixed income.\n- Navigating the complexities of the U.S. immigration system as a non-citizen.\n- Managing the high cost of living in California, potentially leading to concerns about housing affordability and access to basic necessities.\n- Potential feelings of isolation or disconnection from the broader community due to her limited education and non-citizen status.\n\nThis demographic may hold a range of viewpoints on economic and political issues, including:\n\n- Support for policies that improve access to affordable healthcare and social services for immigrants and non-citizens.\n- Concerns about the impact of immigration policies on her own status and that of her family members.\n- Prioritization of economic stability and job opportunities, potentially leading to support for policies that promote economic growth and development.\n- Interest in policies that address the high cost of living in California, such as affordable housing initiatives or subsidies for low-income households.\n- Potential skepticism towards policies that they perceive as favoring native-born citizens over immigrants or non-citizens."
