  "PERSONA": "A 25- to 34-year-old white, Hispanic or Latino male, living in California. He has a limited proficiency in English and primarily speaks Spanish. This could present challenges in accessing certain economic opportunities and navigating English-dominated institutions.\n\nHe did not complete high school, which may limit his job prospects and earning potential. As a non-relative housemate in a shared house, he likely shares living expenses with others, which could help alleviate some financial burdens.\n\nAs a widower, he may face unique emotional and financial challenges, including managing household responsibilities and potential childcare on his own. This could influence his economic concerns, such as seeking policies that support single parents or those who have experienced the loss of a spouse.\n\nGiven his demographics, he may prioritize issues like affordable housing, accessible education, and job training programs. His experiences and concerns could align with those of other young, minority men in similar economic situations, but his specific circumstances as a widower and non-English speaker may set him apart."
