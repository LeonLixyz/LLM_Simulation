  "PERSONA": "This persona is a 35- to 44-year-old widowed female who lives with her parents in California. She is a high school graduate, which may limit her job prospects and earning potential compared to those with higher levels of education. As a result, she may face economic concerns related to job security, income, and career advancement opportunities. Her proficiency in English and US citizenship suggest she may have easier access to social services and job opportunities compared to non-citizens or those with limited English proficiency.\n\nGiven her marital status as a widow, she may be the primary caregiver for any children she has, adding to her financial responsibilities and stressors. Living with her parents could be a result of economic necessity or a desire for familial support during a difficult time. This arrangement may also influence her economic priorities, potentially focusing on affordability, childcare, and social support.\n\nHer economic concerns might include:\n\n- Access to affordable healthcare and childcare\n- Job opportunities and career advancement\n- Financial stability and security\n- Potential reliance on social services or government support\n- Balancing work and family responsibilities\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns this demographic might have include:\n\n- Support for policies that promote job creation, education, and vocational training\n- Interest in affordable healthcare and social services for families and single parents\n- Concerns about economic inequality and access to opportunities\n- Prioritization of family-friendly policies and support for caregivers\n- Potential skepticism towards policies that might negatively impact her economic situation or her family's well-being"
