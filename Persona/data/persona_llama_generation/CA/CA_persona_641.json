  "PERSONA": "A 75- to 84-year-old male, a non-US citizen, and a primary householder in a married-couple household without kids. He was born in Latin America and speaks Spanish as his primary language, with limited English proficiency. He has some college education but no degree, which may have impacted his career prospects and current economic situation. \n\nGiven his age, he is likely retired or semi-retired, with potential reliance on a fixed income or retirement savings. His economic concerns might revolve around healthcare costs, maintaining a stable income, and navigating the complexities of the US healthcare system as a non-citizen. He may have limited access to certain benefits and programs, potentially impacting his economic security.\n\nAs a resident of California, he may be exposed to diverse cultural and social environments, possibly influencing his views on social and economic policies. His experiences as a non-citizen and limited English proficiency might shape his opinions on immigration reform, language access, and social services.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns:\n\n- Access to affordable healthcare and long-term care\n- Financial security in retirement, including potential reliance on a spouse's income or support\n- Navigating complex bureaucratic systems with limited English proficiency\n- Immigration reform and potential pathways to citizenship\n- Language access and cultural sensitivity in public services\n- Potential feelings of isolation or disconnection from the broader community due to language barriers\n\nThis demographic may hold diverse views on various issues, but their experiences as a non-citizen, retiree, and limited English speaker will likely shape their economic and political priorities."
