  "PERSONA": "A 20- to 24-year-old, married, white male of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, who is the primary householder in a single-person household in California. He is a high school graduate, speaks Spanish as his primary language, but is also proficient in English. As a young adult with a relatively low level of education, his job prospects and income level might be limited, potentially influencing his economic priorities and views on education and job training programs. Given his marital status and lack of children, he may have more disposable income but also face different financial pressures and concerns, such as saving for the future or managing household expenses as a single income earner in a costly state like California. He may prioritize issues like affordable housing, healthcare, and access to further education or vocational training. His Hispanic or Latino background may also shape his views on immigration policies and social services."
