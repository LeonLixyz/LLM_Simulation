  "PERSONA": "A 75- to 84-year-old Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity, born in the US, living in California, with a bachelor's degree. She resides in a multigenerational household, which could be a factor in her economic situation, potentially sharing living expenses with other family members. Given her education level, she likely had a professional career, possibly in a field such as education, healthcare, or social services. Her income level might be a combination of retirement savings, pension, and/or part-time work. As a married individual, she may have a partner who contributes to the household income.\n\nPossible economic concerns for this demographic might include:\n- Managing retirement savings and pension in a state with a high cost of living like California\n- Access to affordable healthcare and potential out-of-pocket medical expenses\n- Supporting family members, such as adult children or grandchildren, who may be living in the multigenerational household\n- Balancing personal financial priorities with the needs of the household\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns on economic and political policies:\n- Support for policies that promote affordable healthcare, retirement security, and elder care\n- Interest in education and job training programs that benefit younger generations in the household\n- Concerns about housing affordability and availability in California, particularly for multigenerational households\n- Views on immigration policies, given her Mexican ethnicity and potential connections to immigrant communities"
