  "PERSONA": "This persona is a 20- to 24-year-old Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States, and a US citizen. She is a high school graduate, speaks English well, and identifies Spanish as her primary language. As the primary household member, she is likely responsible for managing the household's finances, which may be a significant concern given her relatively young age and limited education. Her marital status as divorced may impact her economic situation and social support network.\n\nShe resides in California, which is known for being a high-cost state with a diverse economy. This may influence her economic priorities, such as finding stable employment, affording housing, and accessing healthcare. Her education level may limit her job prospects and earning potential, which could lead to concerns about financial stability and opportunities for upward mobility.\n\nAs a young, divorced woman, she may have a range of viewpoints on issues such as:\n\n* Economic inequality and access to affordable education and job training programs\n* Healthcare and reproductive rights\n* Immigration policies, given her Mexican ethnicity and potential connections to immigrant communities\n* Housing affordability and availability in California\n* Social support programs for single households and young adults\n\nHer experiences and concerns may vary depending on her specific circumstances, such as her current employment status, family relationships, and social connections."
