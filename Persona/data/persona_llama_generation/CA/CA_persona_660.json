  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 25 to 34-year-old US-born Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, living in a multi-generational household with her parents in California. She is a high school graduate, proficient in English, and has been divorced. Given her age and educational background, she is likely employed in a service-oriented or entry-level job, possibly in retail, food service, or administrative support. Her economic situation may be modest, with a relatively low income level, and she may be dependent on her family for financial support.\n\nAs a result, her economic concerns may include access to affordable education and job training programs, healthcare, and childcare. She might also be interested in policies addressing income inequality, affordable housing, and social welfare programs. Her marital status as divorced may also influence her views on family law, divorce proceedings, and single-parent support.\n\nGeographically, living in California may expose her to a diverse range of cultures, economic opportunities, and social issues, potentially shaping her views on immigration, education, and healthcare reform. Her experience living with her parents may also give her a unique perspective on intergenerational relationships, caregiving, and social support systems.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic might include:\n\n- Access to affordable education and job training programs to improve career prospects\n- Economic stability and independence from family support\n- Affordable healthcare and social welfare programs for low-income families\n- Family law and divorce proceedings reform\n- Support for single parents and childcare services\n- Immigration policies and their impact on the Hispanic community\n- Intergenerational relationships and caregiving responsibilities"
