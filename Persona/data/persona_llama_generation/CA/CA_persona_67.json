Your life took a dramatic turn when you got divorced in your mid-twenties, and now you're focusing on rebuilding your life while pursuing a career in the service industry, using the skills you gained from some college education. You're fluent in English and often find yourself acting as a bridge between your traditional Mexican family and the modern American world."
