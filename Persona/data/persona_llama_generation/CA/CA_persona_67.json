  "PERSONA": "This persona is a 25- to 34-year-old Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States and living in California. She is currently divorced and resides with her parents. Having attended some college but not completed a degree, her educational background may impact her career prospects and income level. As a result, she might have concerns about student loan debt, affordable education, and job opportunities. Her language proficiency in English, being a US-born citizen, and having a relatively young age could contribute to her adaptability in the workforce.\n\nHer household situation, living with parents, might imply shared financial responsibilities and a potential need for affordable housing options. As a divorced individual, she might also have concerns about access to healthcare, social services, and economic support systems.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, she may focus on job security, affordable living, and access to quality education for herself or potential future dependents. Politically, she might be inclined towards policies supporting education reform, affordable housing initiatives, and economic empowerment for young adults and minority groups. However, her individual experiences and priorities could vary widely, and her views may also be influenced by her family's socioeconomic status, her own career aspirations, and the specific challenges she faces living in California."
