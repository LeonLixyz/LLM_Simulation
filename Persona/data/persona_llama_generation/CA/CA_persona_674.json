  "PERSONA": "A 25-34-year-old married white Hispanic woman living with her parents in California. She has a high school diploma and speaks English well, in addition to Spanish. As a resident of California, she may be influenced by the state's economic conditions, including a high cost of living. Her decision to live with her parents could indicate that she is facing financial constraints, potentially due to student loan debt, expensive housing, or limited job opportunities.\n\nGiven her education level, she may work in a service-oriented or entry-level job, with limited career advancement opportunities. Her economic priorities may include affordable housing, access to higher education, and job training programs. As a married woman, she may also be concerned about family planning, healthcare, and childcare costs. \n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic might include:\n- Support for policies that address affordable housing and student loan debt.\n- Interest in job training programs and vocational education to improve career prospects.\n- Concerns about access to quality, affordable healthcare, particularly reproductive healthcare.\n- Potential support for policies that benefit families, such as childcare subsidies and parental leave.\n- Views on immigration policies, given her Hispanic background and potential connections to immigrant communities.\n- Possible interest in environmental policies, given California's emphasis on sustainability and environmental protection."
