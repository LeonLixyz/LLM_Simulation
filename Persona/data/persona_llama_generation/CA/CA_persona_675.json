Born in the US, he is a US citizen and speaks English well, despite his primary language being an Indo-European language other than English. Living in California, he may be influenced by the state's diverse economy and high cost of living. As a non-veteran, he may not have the same economic benefits as veterans.\n\nGiven his age and education level, he may be nearing retirement or already retired, with a moderate income and possibly some pension or social security benefits.
