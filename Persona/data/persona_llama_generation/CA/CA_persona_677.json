  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 60- to 64-year-old US-born, Mexican-American female, who is the primary household member. She has never been married, has no children, and lives alone in California. She likely faces challenges with English proficiency, speaking it less than very well, and primarily communicates in Spanish. With less than a 9th-grade education, her job prospects may be limited, and she may be employed in low-skilled or service-oriented sectors. She may work in the informal economy or hold multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet.\n\nAs a single female without children, her economic concerns might focus on retirement security, access to affordable healthcare, and managing living expenses, particularly in a state like California with a high cost of living. Her limited English proficiency and low education level may create barriers to accessing information and navigating social services, which could impact her economic stability and overall well-being.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic might include:\n- Struggling to afford basic needs like housing, food, and healthcare due to limited income and education.\n- Difficulty navigating social services and government programs due to language barriers.\n- Limited access to job training or education opportunities that could improve her economic prospects.\n- Frustration with the high cost of living in California and the need for affordable housing options.\n- Concerns about retirement security and the ability to maintain independence as she ages.\n- Potential feelings of isolation due to limited social connections and lack of family support."
