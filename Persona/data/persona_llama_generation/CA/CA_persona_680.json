  "PERSONA": "This persona represents a 25- to 34-year-old divorced white female, living in California. As a primary householder with no spouse present, she is likely the primary decision-maker for her household. Her graduate or professional degree suggests that she has a higher earning potential and may be employed in a professional or managerial role, potentially in a field such as law, medicine, or business. \n\nGiven her education level and location in California, she may have a higher income, possibly above the state median, and may be more likely to own a home or rent in a higher-cost area. Her economic concerns might include managing the costs of living in California, paying off student loans, and planning for long-term financial security. She may also be concerned with issues related to women's rights, education, and healthcare.\n\nAs a resident of California, she may be influenced by the state's progressive policies and may prioritize environmental issues, such as climate change, and social issues, such as access to affordable healthcare and education. However, her specific views on these issues cannot be determined solely based on her demographic information, and she may hold a range of viewpoints within the liberal to moderate spectrum."
