  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 45- to 54-year-old, foreign-born, non-U.S. citizen female from Latin America, living in California. She resides with her parents, is never married, and has limited education (less than 9th grade). She speaks English well, but this may not be her native language. Given her educational background and living situation, her economic prospects might be limited, potentially leading to concerns about job security, income stability, and access to healthcare. \n\nHer economic situation is likely precarious, with possible reliance on her parents for financial support. She may face challenges in the job market due to limited education and potential language barriers, despite speaking English well. As a non-U.S. citizen, she may have limited access to social services and government assistance programs.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic include:\n- Immigration reform and pathways to citizenship\n- Access to affordable education and job training programs\n- Healthcare access and affordability\n- Economic opportunities and job security\n- Language support services for non-native English speakers\n- Social services and government assistance programs for non-U.S. citizens\n\nDiversity within this demographic group is acknowledged by recognizing that:\n- Not all foreign-born individuals from Latin America have the same experience or background.\n- Limited education does not necessarily dictate a person's intelligence, work ethic, or potential.\n- Living with parents at an older age may be due to various factors, including cultural norms, financial necessity, or personal choice.\n- Non-U.S. citizens may have varying levels of engagement with their communities and varying degrees of access to resources."
