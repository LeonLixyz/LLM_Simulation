  "PERSONA": "This demographic represents an 85-year-old Hispanic male who has never been married, holds a Bachelor's degree, and was born in the United States. He resides in California, likely in a multigenerational household with his parents, despite his advanced age. As someone who speaks English well but primarily speaks Spanish, he may identify with both US and Hispanic cultural influences. \n\nGiven his educational background and age, he may have had a fulfilling career but could now be more focused on retirement, healthcare, and social security concerns. His experience living in a multigenerational household could make him more empathetic towards policies supporting family caregivers and the elderly. \n\nPossible economic concerns and priorities for this demographic might include:\n- Access to quality, affordable healthcare, particularly for age-related health issues\n- Preservation of social security benefits and pension plans\n- Support for multigenerational households and caregivers\n- Potential tax implications on retirement savings\n- Housing and transportation needs suitable for seniors\n- Opportunities for continued education and personal development in retirement\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns might range from conservative stances on preserving traditional social security and pension plans, to more progressive views on increasing support for caregivers and multigenerational households."
