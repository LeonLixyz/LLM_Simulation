  "PERSONA": "A 25- to 34-year-old American Indian and Alaska Native female, living in California as the primary householder of a single-person household. She is divorced, holds a Bachelor's degree, and speaks a non-English language at home but is proficient in English. Her educational background likely provides her with better career prospects, potentially in fields that value her unique cultural perspective.\n\nAs a single person without kids, her economic priorities might focus on personal financial stability, career advancement, and possibly saving for long-term goals, such as homeownership or further education. Her experience as a divorced individual may have influenced her views on family and relationships, potentially making her more independent and self-reliant.\n\nLiving in California, she is likely exposed to a diverse cultural environment and may be concerned with issues affecting her community, such as access to education, job opportunities, and cultural preservation. Her experience as a member of an underrepresented group may make her more aware of social and economic inequalities, potentially influencing her views on policies related to education, employment, and social justice.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns:\n\n- Emphasis on education and job training programs that cater to diverse cultural backgrounds\n- Support for policies promoting economic opportunities and financial stability for single-person households\n- Interest in environmental issues, given the cultural significance of land and natural resources in many American Indian and Alaska Native communities\n- Potential skepticism towards policies that may disproportionately affect her community, such as those related to land use, resource management, or cultural heritage preservation\n- Possible support for policies addressing social and economic inequalities, such as affordable housing, healthcare, and education initiatives."
