  "PERSONA": "This demographic represents a 65-74-year-old, white, Hispanic or Latino male who is a primary household member in California. Born in Latin America, he is not a U.S. citizen but speaks English well. With some college education but no degree, his economic situation may be influenced by his limited education and non-citizenship status, potentially affecting his job opportunities and access to certain benefits. \n\nAs a widower, he may face unique financial challenges, including managing household expenses alone and potentially caring for himself. Given his age, healthcare costs and social security benefits might be significant concerns. His household type may have changed due to grown children moving out, which could lead to feelings of emptiness or a shift in social connections. This demographic may prioritize affordable healthcare, social services, and possible pathways to citizenship, while also being concerned about retirement security and managing living expenses in a high-cost state like California."
