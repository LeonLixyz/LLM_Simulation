  "PERSONA": "This 25- to 34-year-old male, likely of Asian ethnicity, is a non-U.S. citizen born in Asia and currently resides in California. He is married but may face unique challenges due to limited English proficiency and lower educational attainment (less than 9th grade). As a non-relative housemate, he likely shares living expenses with others, which might impact his economic priorities. Given his limited English and education, his job prospects might be restricted to low-skilled sectors, resulting in lower income levels. His lack of U.S. citizenship could also limit access to certain economic opportunities or social services.\n\nPossible economic concerns for this demographic include:\n- Limited job opportunities due to language barriers and lower education\n- Lower income levels and financial instability\n- Dependence on others for economic support, given shared living arrangements\n- Potential difficulties accessing healthcare and social services due to citizenship status\n- Limited understanding of U.S. policies and economic systems due to language proficiency issues\n\nPossible viewpoints on economic and political policies:\n- Support for policies promoting language education and job training programs\n- Advocacy for pathways to citizenship or improved access to social services for non-citizens\n- Concerns about affordable housing and cost of living in urban areas like California\n- Interest in policies addressing income inequality and access to better-paying jobs\n- Potential skepticism about complex economic and political systems due to limited understanding"
