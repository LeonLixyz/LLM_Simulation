  "PERSONA": "A 45-54-year-old male of Hispanic descent, born in Latin America and residing in California. He has a graduate or professional degree, indicating a high level of education, which may translate to better job prospects and higher income. However, his non-citizen status could limit his career advancement or access to certain benefits. He speaks English well, which would aid in navigating everyday life and professional settings in the US.\n\nAs a never-married individual living with his parents, his household structure may be influenced by cultural or economic factors, potentially affecting his economic priorities. His household type is assumed to be multi-generational, which may lead to shared financial responsibilities and a stronger sense of family obligation.\n\nThis demographic may have concerns about immigration policies, access to education and job opportunities, and healthcare. They might prioritize economic growth, affordable housing, and social programs supporting immigrant communities. However, it's essential to acknowledge the diversity within this demographic, as individual experiences and viewpoints can vary greatly depending on factors like the specific country of origin, length of time in the US, and personal circumstances."
