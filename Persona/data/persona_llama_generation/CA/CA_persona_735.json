  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65-74-year-old Hispanic male living in California, who is married (but possibly separated) and a US-born citizen. He has some college education but no degree, which may impact his career prospects and income level. Given his age, he is likely retired or semi-retired, possibly relying on a fixed income or social security. His household structure, with a spouse (from whom he may be separated), might influence his economic concerns, such as healthcare, retirement savings, and housing costs. As a resident of California, he may have concerns about the high cost of living, particularly housing and healthcare costs, which could be exacerbated by his fixed income. His economic priorities might include maintaining access to affordable healthcare, managing retirement savings, and navigating the implications of potential separation on his financial situation. This demographic may have varying viewpoints on issues like social security reform, Medicare, and affordable housing initiatives, with some individuals prioritizing personal financial security and others advocating for broader social support systems."
