  "PERSONA": "This persona represents a 25-34-year-old male who identifies as White, likely of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity due to his Spanish language proficiency. He is a high school graduate, lives with his parents, and is married. Born in Africa but now a US citizen, he speaks English well, indicating a relatively high level of acculturation. \n\nEconomically, his high school education might limit his job prospects and earning potential. Living with parents may indicate financial dependence or shared household responsibilities. As a married individual, he may have additional financial responsibilities or expectations for the future. His proficiency in Spanish could provide job opportunities in multilingual work environments.\n\nGeographically, residing in California, particularly in urban areas, might expose him to a diverse economy with various job opportunities, but also high living costs. His economic concerns could range from affordable housing, access to better job opportunities, and navigating the complexities of the US job market as a foreign-born citizen. Politically, he might prioritize issues related to immigration, education, and economic mobility, with a diverse range of viewpoints possible given his unique background and life circumstances."
