  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65-74-year-old white female, born in Asia but now a US citizen, living in California with her spouse. She has limited formal education, having completed less than 9th grade, which may impact her career prospects and income level. As she is now married and living with her spouse, her household type is likely a married-couple household. Her language proficiency in English is good, but she may face unique cultural and linguistic challenges as a foreign-born individual.\n\nHer economic situation is likely influenced by her limited education and possibly lower job prospects, but her household type suggests she may have shared financial responsibilities and support from her spouse. She may be retired or semi-retired, with potential reliance on social security or pension income. Her main economic concerns could be healthcare costs, retirement security, and maintaining a stable income in her golden years.\n\nAs a resident of California, she may be affected by the state's high cost of living, particularly housing costs, and may prioritize policies related to affordable housing, healthcare, and senior services. Her foreign birth and Asian background may also influence her views on immigration policies and cultural diversity. She may hold diverse views on these topics, ranging from conservative to liberal, depending on her individual experiences and values."
