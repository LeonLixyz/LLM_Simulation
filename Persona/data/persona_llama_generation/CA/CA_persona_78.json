  "PERSONA": "A 35- to 44-year-old married white male, born in the US but in a different state than his current residence in California. He is a non-veteran and holds a Bachelor's degree. He speaks English well, although his primary language is another Indo-European language. He resides in a multi-generational household as an other relative of the household, possibly living with his spouse's family or having extended family members in the household.\n\nGiven his education level and the fact that he is married, his economic situation is likely stable, with a middle to upper-middle-class income, possibly in the range of $60,000 to $120,000 per year. He may be working in a professional or managerial role, potentially in industries that value his language skills. Homeownership might be a challenge in California due to the high cost of living, so he might be renting or relying on family support.\n\nHis economic concerns may include the cost of living in California, access to affordable housing, and possibly the financial responsibilities that come with being part of a multi-generational household. Politically, he may be interested in policies that support education, affordable housing, and possibly immigration reform, given his proficiency in another language. However, his views could vary widely, and he may also be concerned with issues such as taxation, healthcare, and social security, given his age and marital status."
