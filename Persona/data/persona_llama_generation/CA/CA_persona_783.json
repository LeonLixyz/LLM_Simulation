  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 55- to 59-year-old male, born in the US, and residing in California. He has a limited educational background, with less than a 9th-grade education. His household structure is likely a married couple or unmarried partner household, where he is the spouse of the household head. Given his limited education, his job prospects and income level may be limited. He likely works in the service sector or manual labor jobs, which may not provide job security or high wages. His family structure may include children or step-children from his partner's previous relationships. As a resident of California, he may be concerned about the high cost of living, housing affordability, and access to healthcare. He may also be concerned about job security, minimum wage, and workers' rights. His limited education may make it difficult for him to adapt to changing job market demands, and he may be worried about his ability to support his family. On the other hand, he may value job training programs, education initiatives, and social safety nets that can help him and his family. He may also be interested in policies that promote affordable housing, reduce income inequality, and support workers' rights."
