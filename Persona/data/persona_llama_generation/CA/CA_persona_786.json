  "PERSONA": "A 45- to 54-year-old, never-married Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, born in Europe but living in California. He resides with his parents, indicating a strong family bond or possible economic dependence. He holds a graduate or professional degree, suggesting a high level of educational attainment, which could translate into better job prospects and higher income. However, his English proficiency is limited, which might impact his career advancement or integration into certain sectors of the economy.\n\nGiven his non-citizen status, he might face challenges accessing certain social services or benefits, potentially influencing his economic priorities, such as seeking pathways to citizenship or navigating healthcare access. His experiences as a foreign-born individual in the U.S. could shape his views on immigration policies, with a range of possible viewpoints from advocating for more inclusive policies to facing challenges that make him more cautious about immigration reform.\n\nHis living situation in California, a state with a high cost of living, particularly in urban areas, might make housing affordability and cost of living significant concerns. His economic situation could be further influenced by his job sector and income level, which are not specified, but given his educational background, he might be employed in a professional or managerial role. This could position him as having a moderate to high income, yet still facing challenges related to the high cost of living in California.\n\nPossible economic concerns or priorities for this demographic might include:\n- Access to affordable healthcare\n- Pathways to U.S. citizenship\n- Job opportunities that match his educational qualifications\n- Housing affordability and cost of living adjustments\n- Immigration reform and its implications"
