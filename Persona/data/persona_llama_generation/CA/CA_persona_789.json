  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 75- to 84-year-old, white, US-born female who has been married but is currently separated. She is the primary householder and lives alone without children. Holding a graduate or professional degree, she likely has a strong educational foundation that has influenced her career and economic prospects. As a Spanish speaker who speaks English well, she may have diverse cultural connections and possibly a broader perspective on social issues.\n\nGiven her age, she is likely retired or semi-retired, potentially with a stable income from retirement funds, pensions, or Social Security benefits. Her living situation as a single household without children may lead to lower household expenses but also means she lacks the support system younger family members could provide.\n\nLiving in California, she is likely exposed to a diverse range of economic and social issues, including high living costs, healthcare concerns, and environmental issues. As a result, her economic priorities may focus on maintaining a stable retirement income, managing healthcare costs, and ensuring access to quality services. She may be concerned about the impact of economic policies on seniors, such as changes to Social Security, Medicare, or long-term care services.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic might include:\n\n- Economic security in retirement, including the sustainability of Social Security and pension funds\n- Access to affordable, quality healthcare, particularly as it relates to age-related health issues\n- Housing affordability and potential displacement due to gentrification in urban California\n- Environmental concerns, such as climate change and its impact on her community\n- Support for policies that benefit seniors, such as increased funding for senior services or protections against elder abuse\n\nThis persona represents a diverse range of experiences within the demographic group, acknowledging that individual perspectives can vary widely based on personal experiences, life choices, and exposure to different social and economic contexts."
