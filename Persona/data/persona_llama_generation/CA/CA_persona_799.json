  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65- to 74-year-old Chinese male living in California. He holds a bachelor's degree, indicating a relatively high level of education, which likely provided him with better career prospects. However, his current employment status is unknown, and his age suggests he might be retired or semi-retired. As a non-U.S. citizen, he may face certain restrictions or concerns regarding his residency status, healthcare, and social security benefits. \n\nAs the primary householder of a single-person household without kids, his living expenses might be relatively lower compared to larger families. However, his marital status as 'never married' could imply that he might rely more heavily on his personal savings or pension for financial support. \n\nLiving in California, he is likely exposed to a diverse, urban environment with a high cost of living. This could influence his economic concerns, such as housing affordability, access to affordable healthcare, and the impact of state and local policies on his daily life. \n\nGiven his age and education level, he may prioritize issues like Social Security, Medicare, and affordable healthcare. As a non-citizen, he may also be concerned about immigration policies and their potential effects on his residency status. His ability to speak English well and holding a bachelor's degree may make him more likely to engage with local politics and be informed about policy issues. However, his specific views on these topics would depend on his individual experiences and priorities."
