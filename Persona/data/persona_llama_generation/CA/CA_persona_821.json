  "PERSONA": "A 65-74-year-old, US-born Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, married and living with her spouse and children in California. She is the primary householder, holds a high school diploma, and speaks English well, although her primary language is Spanish. As a resident of California, she may be concerned about the state's high cost of living, particularly housing and healthcare costs, which could impact her retirement plans. Her economic situation is likely stable, but she may be concerned about her children's financial futures and access to quality education. Given her demographic, she may prioritize issues like affordable healthcare, Social Security, and education. Her viewpoint could range from conservative, focusing on family values and traditional roles, to liberal, emphasizing social support and government assistance for low-income families."
