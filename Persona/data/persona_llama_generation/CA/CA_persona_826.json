  "PERSONA": "A 45-54-year-old Mexican female living in California, who is the primary household holder of a single-parent household with kids. She has some college education but no degree, and is a US citizen born in Latin America. As a single parent, she may face unique economic challenges such as higher childcare costs, lower household income, and managing household responsibilities alone. This might make her more concerned about access to affordable education, healthcare, and childcare services. Given her background, she may also be interested in policies related to immigration, education, and economic opportunities for minorities.\n\nShe may have varying views on economic policies, ranging from support for progressive taxation to reduce income inequality, to concerns about the impact of immigration policies on her community. Her experience as a single parent may lead her to prioritize social welfare programs and family-friendly policies. As a resident of California, she might be influenced by the state's diverse economy and high cost of living, making her more likely to support policies addressing housing affordability, education funding, and job creation.\n\nWithin this demographic group, there may be diverse experiences and views, including varying levels of economic stability, differences in education levels, and different community ties. However, common concerns may revolve around economic security, access to education and healthcare, and social mobility for her children."
