  "PERSONA": "This persona represents a 55-59-year-old, married but separated, female who is the primary householder of a single-person household in California. Born in Latin America, she is a US citizen who speaks Spanish at home but is also proficient in English. With a high school diploma, her educational background may influence her career prospects, potentially limiting her to lower-skilled or lower-paying jobs.\n\nGiven her age and marital status, she may face unique economic challenges, such as retirement planning as a single income earner or navigating the implications of separation on her financial stability. Her household income may be lower than that of dual-income households, affecting her ability to afford living expenses, especially in a high-cost state like California.\n\nShe may prioritize economic policies that address affordable housing, access to healthcare, and job security for older workers. As a high school graduate, she might support vocational training programs or education initiatives that enhance employability and career advancement opportunities.\n\nSome of her concerns could include managing living expenses, maintaining health insurance coverage, and ensuring a stable retirement. She may also be interested in policies addressing social security benefits, pension plans, or programs supporting single-income households. Her perspective may be shaped by her experiences as a foreign-born US citizen, potentially influencing her views on immigration and social integration policies."
