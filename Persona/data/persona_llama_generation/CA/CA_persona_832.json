  "PERSONA": "This individual is an 85-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States but in a different state from her current residence in California. She is a widow and the primary householder of a married-couple household without kids, suggesting her spouse may have passed away. Her education includes some college but no degree, which may impact her career prospects and retirement security.\n\nGiven her age and marital status, she may rely on a pension or retirement savings and potentially face concerns related to healthcare costs, social security, and long-term care. As a homeowner, she may have housing-related expenses such as property taxes and maintenance. Her ability to speak English well, despite Spanish being her primary language, indicates she may be more integrated into mainstream American society and more likely to engage with local and national politics.\n\nHer economic priorities may include:\n\n- Healthcare and access to quality medical services\n- Maintaining a stable and secure retirement income\n- Managing housing expenses and property taxes\n- Potential concerns about the cost of long-term care\n\nPolitically, this demographic may be concerned with:\n\n- Social Security and pension reform\n- Healthcare policy and access to affordable medical services\n- Immigration and border control policies (given her Mexican heritage)\n- State and local policies affecting housing and property taxes in California"
