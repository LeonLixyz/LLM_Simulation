  "PERSONA": "A 37-year-old Mexican woman living in a multigenerational household with her parents in California, she has resided in the US since immigrating from Mexico at a young age. As a high school graduate, her career prospects may be limited, and she likely holds a lower- to moderate-paying job, possibly in the service or retail sector. Her strong family ties and household responsibilities influence her economic priorities, which might include contributing to the family income, saving for long-term goals, and accessing affordable healthcare and education for herself and her family. \n\nLiving in California, she faces a high cost of living, which could impact her economic concerns and priorities, such as affording housing, transportation, and basic necessities. Her primary language at home is Spanish, which might limit her access to certain job opportunities or social services, but her ability to speak English well expands her potential career prospects.\n\nAs a non-US citizen, she may face unique challenges in accessing certain benefits, such as healthcare or education assistance, and may be more vulnerable to economic instability. Her focus on career advancement and financial stability might lead her to prioritize policies that support immigrant communities, affordable education and job training, and access to social services.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic might include:\n\n- Support for immigration reform and pathways to citizenship\n- Access to affordable education and job training programs\n- Advocacy for workers' rights and fair wages in low-paying industries\n- Concerns about healthcare access and affordability for immigrant communities\n- Prioritization of policies that support multigenerational households and family caregivers"
