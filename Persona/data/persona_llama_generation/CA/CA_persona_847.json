  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 75- to 84-year-old, white and American Indian/Alaska Native female, living in California. She has an associate's degree and has never been married. As a non-relative housemate, she resides with others in a shared living arrangement, which may indicate a need for companionship, financial assistance, or both. Her English proficiency is strong, and she has no reported veteran status.\n\nGiven her age, she may be retired or semi-retired, potentially living on a fixed income, which could be a mix of personal savings, social security benefits, and possibly a pension. Her associate's degree could have led to a stable, middle-income career before retirement, but her current economic situation might be more modest.\n\nAs a resident of California, she may face concerns related to the state's high cost of living, housing costs, and access to healthcare. She might prioritize economic policies addressing affordable housing, social security, and healthcare for seniors. Her experiences as a never-married individual might also lead her to value policies supporting single individuals, such as affordable housing options or social programs catering to seniors without family support.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic might include:\n\n- Affordability of healthcare and long-term care\n- Access to affordable housing and potential rent control\n- Social security and pension benefits\n- Support for seniors without family support systems\n- Concerns about isolation and social interaction in old age\n- Interest in programs promoting intergenerational connections and community engagement\n- Views on immigration and diversity, potentially influenced by her multiracial background\n\nThis persona highlights the complexities of an older, never-married woman living in a shared household, with a mix of economic and social concerns that might shape her views on economic and political issues."
