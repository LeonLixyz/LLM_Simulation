  "PERSONA": "A 65-74-year-old Hispanic female living in California, married, and residing with her spouse. She holds a bachelor's degree, which likely provided her with better job prospects and economic stability. As a non-veteran and with a spouse, she might have a two-income household or be reliant on her spouse's income, given her age. Her English proficiency and US citizenship indicate she has likely been integrated into the workforce and participated in the US economy for most of her life. Her household might be in the process of transitioning to retirement or semi-retirement.\n\nPossible economic concerns for this demographic include healthcare costs, retirement savings, and maintaining a stable income during the golden years. She may prioritize social security benefits, Medicare, and pension plans. As a resident of California, she might be concerned about the state's high cost of living, housing prices, and access to quality, affordable healthcare. This demographic might also have varying views on immigration policies, given her Hispanic background, and may be interested in policies supporting education and economic opportunities for underrepresented groups."
