  "PERSONA": "This persona represents a 75- to 84-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, living in California, who is likely retired and may be living with a spouse or independently. As a high school graduate, her career prospects and lifetime earnings may have been limited, contributing to a lower retirement income. Given her age and marital status, she may have caregiving responsibilities for a spouse or rely on support from family members due to potential health issues. \n\nHer economic concerns might include managing retirement savings, accessing affordable healthcare, and dealing with rising living costs, especially in a state like California with a high cost of living. She may also be concerned about housing affordability, as she may be renting or struggling with mortgage payments on a fixed income.\n\nIn terms of political views, she might prioritize issues related to senior care, Social Security, Medicare, and affordable housing. As a long-term resident of California, she may also have opinions on state-specific policies, such as Proposition 13, which affects property taxes, and the state's efforts to address the housing crisis. Her experiences and concerns may influence her voting decisions, with a focus on candidates who address the needs of seniors and offer solutions to the challenges she faces in her daily life.\n\nAs a member of the Hispanic community, she may also be interested in policies affecting her community, such as immigration reform, access to healthcare, and education. However, her views may vary based on her individual experiences and those of her family."
