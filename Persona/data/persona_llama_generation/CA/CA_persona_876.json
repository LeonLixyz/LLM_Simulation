  "PERSONA": "A 35- to 44-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, born in Latin America but now a US citizen, resides in California as a single mother and primary household earner. She has a high school diploma and speaks English well. As a single mother, her household type has been revised to reflect her marital status more accurately. Her economic situation is likely to be challenging, balancing work and childcare responsibilities. She may rely on a stable job with a moderate income, possibly in the service or administrative sector, given her education level. She might be concerned about access to affordable childcare, healthcare, and education for her children. Geographic location in California could mean higher costs of living, adding to her economic concerns. She may prioritize policies addressing these issues, such as affordable housing, education funding, and job opportunities. Within this demographic, there may be varying levels of economic stability, with some women having more support from family or community, while others may face greater challenges due to immigration status or limited job opportunities."
