However, his graduate or professional degree could provide better job opportunities, possibly in fields that value bilingualism or diverse cultural backgrounds. As a primary householder with kids, he may prioritize economic policies that support working families, such as affordable childcare, education, and healthcare.\n\nHis experience as a foreign-born individual and a non-English proficient speaker may lead him to value policies supporting immigrant integration, language access, and cultural diversity.
