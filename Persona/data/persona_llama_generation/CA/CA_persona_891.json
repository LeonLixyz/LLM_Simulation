  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 45- to 54-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States. He resides in California, specifically in a multi-generational household with his parents. He holds a bachelor's degree but may face language barriers due to speaking English less than very well. As a result, he may prioritize access to language assistance programs, bilingual services, or job opportunities that accommodate his language proficiency.\n\nGiven his educational background, he may have better job prospects, but his language limitations could affect his career advancement. His household income might be influenced by his parents' economic situation, and he may contribute to the household income. He may be concerned about affordable housing, healthcare, and social security for his parents, as well as his own financial stability and retirement plans.\n\nAs a never-married individual, he may not have immediate family responsibilities but may still prioritize family-oriented policies, such as support for multigenerational households or caregiving services for aging parents. His views on economic and political issues may be shaped by his experiences as a Hispanic individual in California, including access to education, job opportunities, and social services. He may also be interested in policies that address language barriers and promote cultural diversity."
