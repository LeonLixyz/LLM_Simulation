  "PERSONA": "A 75- to 84-year-old Mexican-American woman living in California with her spouse in a household without kids. She has some college education but no degree. As the primary householder, she likely manages the household finances. Born in Europe, she has become a US citizen and speaks English well. Given her age and demographic, she might be concerned about healthcare costs, social security, and retirement savings. She may also be interested in policies that support older adults, such as affordable housing and long-term care options. Her experience as an immigrant might make her empathetic to immigrant rights and the challenges of navigating the US system. As a married couple without kids, she and her spouse may prioritize financial security and stability over other concerns. She may hold a range of views on issues like taxation, education, and economic development, influenced by her life experiences, education, and cultural background."
