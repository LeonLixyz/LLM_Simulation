  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65 to 74-year-old male who was born in Asia but now resides in California. He is not a U.S. citizen and speaks Spanish as his primary language, but he also speaks English well. His highest level of education is some college, but he does not hold a degree. He has never been married and lives with his parents in a multigenerational household. His economic situation is likely influenced by his family, as he may rely on them for financial support. Given his age, he may also be concerned about access to healthcare and social security benefits, which could be complicated by his non-citizen status. His experiences as an immigrant and a non-citizen may shape his views on immigration and healthcare policies. He may prioritize affordable healthcare and elder care options. Additionally, as a resident of California, he may be concerned about the high cost of living, particularly housing costs, which could impact his family's living situation."
