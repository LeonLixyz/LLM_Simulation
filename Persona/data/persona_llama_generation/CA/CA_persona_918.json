  "PERSONA": "This persona is a 35- to 44-year-old Hispanic female, the primary householder of a single-female household with children. She is married but separated and has an associate's degree. Born in Latin America, she is a non-U.S. citizen who speaks Spanish as her primary language and has limited English proficiency.\n\nEconomically, she may face challenges related to language barriers, limited job opportunities due to her non-citizen status, and the responsibility of raising children as a single household head. Her associate's degree provides her with some career prospects, but her job sector and income level might be limited by her language skills and immigration status.\n\nLiving in California, she may have access to diverse cultural communities and resources but also face a high cost of living, which could exacerbate economic concerns. Her primary economic concerns might include job security, affordable housing, access to education for her children, and healthcare. She may also worry about her immigration status and potential pathways to citizenship.\n\nAs a non-U.S. citizen, she may not be eligible to vote, but her family's well-being could be significantly influenced by local and national policies, particularly those related to immigration, education, and social services. Her views on economic and political issues might be shaped by her experiences as a single mother, a non-citizen, and a member of the Hispanic community.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns for this demographic might include:\n\n- Support for policies that provide a pathway to citizenship or improve the lives of undocumented immigrants\n- Advocacy for affordable education and childcare options to support working mothers\n- Concerns about job opportunities, fair wages, and workers' rights\n- Prioritization of access to healthcare and social services for low-income families\n- Potential skepticism towards policies that might negatively impact immigrant communities or exacerbate income inequality."
