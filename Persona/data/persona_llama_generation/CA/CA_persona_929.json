  "PERSONA": "A 60- to 64-year-old white female, living in California, who is the primary householder of a married couple without children. She has a high school education but did not receive a diploma. This may impact her career prospects and potentially affect her economic views. As a married couple, they may have a combined income, which could influence their economic situation and priorities. \n\nGiven her age, she may be nearing retirement or already retired, which could lead to concerns about social security, healthcare, and retirement savings. Her lack of a high school diploma might also make her more concerned about job security and the value of education in the workforce.\n\nAs a resident of California, she may be exposed to a diverse range of perspectives and economic conditions, from urban to rural areas. Her views on economic policies might be shaped by the state's strong economy, high cost of living, and issues like housing affordability.\n\nSome potential economic concerns or priorities for this demographic might include:\n- Access to affordable healthcare, especially in older age\n- Retirement savings and social security benefits\n- Housing affordability and property taxes\n- Job security and opportunities for those without a high school diploma\n- Education and workforce development programs for future generations\n- State-specific issues like drought, wildfires, and environmental policies"
