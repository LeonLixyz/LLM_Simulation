  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 60- to 64-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States. He is a high school graduate, fluent in English, and has lived in California, although born in a different state. He is the primary household member in a cohabiting couple without children and is currently married, except separated. \n\nEconomically, as a high school graduate, he may have had access to a range of job opportunities, potentially in sectors such as retail, hospitality, or manufacturing. His income level might be modest, with possible annual earnings in the lower to middle range. As the primary household member, he likely has significant financial responsibilities.\n\nGiven his age, he may be approaching or already in retirement, which could impact his economic priorities, such as Social Security benefits, Medicare, and pension plans. His experience with the US healthcare system, particularly in California, could shape his views on healthcare reform. \n\nThis demographic may be concerned with issues like affordable housing, especially in a state like California known for high living costs. He may prioritize economic stability, job security, and access to affordable healthcare. His views on immigration policies could be influenced by his Mexican heritage, but it's also possible he might identify more with his US-born experience and have diverse opinions on the matter. \n\nAs a homeowner or renter in California, he might be interested in state and local policies addressing housing affordability, property taxes, and environmental concerns. His cohabiting relationship without children could mean he has more disposable income, which may influence his spending habits and economic priorities."
