  "PERSONA": "A 20- to 24-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States and a US citizen. He is the primary householder in a single-person household, never married, and has no children. He speaks English fluently, having been born and raised in the US. With some college education but no degree, his career prospects might be limited, but he may have gained practical skills through his studies or work experience.\n\nEconomically, he might be in an entry-level position or working multiple jobs to support himself, with a relatively low to moderate income. As a primary householder in California, one of the most expensive states in the US, his housing costs, including rent, might be a significant portion of his expenses. This could lead to concerns about affordability, housing security, and the overall cost of living.\n\nHis views on economic policies might be shaped by his experiences as a young adult navigating the workforce and trying to make ends meet. He may prioritize policies addressing affordable housing, job security, and access to education and job training programs. As a California resident, he might also be concerned about issues like the state's high taxes, the rising cost of living, and the impact of environmental policies on the economy.\n\nIn terms of political views, he might be open to policies that promote social mobility, such as increased funding for education and job training programs, as well as initiatives to address income inequality. However, he may also be skeptical of policies that he perceives as increasing his tax burden or limiting job opportunities. His views could be diverse, reflecting the complexities of his experiences as a young Hispanic male in California."
