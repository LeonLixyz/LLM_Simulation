  "PERSONA": "A 55- to 59-year-old, non-Hispanic White female living in California. She has some college education but no degree and speaks English well. As a divorced individual, she might be living in a non-traditional household arrangement, possibly with other relatives or as part of a multi-generational household. Her economic concerns may revolve around maintaining financial stability, accessing affordable healthcare, and managing her living situation. \n\n Given her education level and lack of a college degree, she may face limited job prospects and lower income levels, making her potentially concerned about issues such as affordable housing, job security, and access to social services. As a resident of California, she may also be concerned with the state's high cost of living, particularly in areas like housing and healthcare. Her priorities might include policies that support affordable housing, education, and job training programs. She may also be interested in policies addressing healthcare access and affordability, particularly as she approaches retirement age.\n\n Her viewpoints on economic and political issues may vary widely, but she may be inclined to support policies that promote economic stability, social welfare, and access to essential services."
