  "PERSONA": "This demographic represents a 65- to 74-year-old Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States, but in a different state than California, where she currently resides. She lives in a multigenerational household with her parents, and has never been married. She is a high school graduate and speaks English well, with English being her primary language.\n\nAs a member of an older demographic, her economic situation may be influenced by her retirement status, potential pension or social security benefits, and any part-time or supplemental income. Her high school education may have limited her career prospects and earning potential, which could impact her financial security in retirement.\n\nLiving in California, she may have concerns about the high cost of living, particularly housing costs, and access to affordable healthcare. As a resident of a multigenerational household, she may also have caregiving responsibilities for her aging parents, which could influence her economic and healthcare priorities.\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns this demographic might have include:\n\n- Affordability of healthcare and long-term care for herself and her parents\n- Access to affordable housing and concerns about gentrification in California\n- Economic security in retirement, including the impact of inflation on fixed incomes\n- Support for social programs and services that benefit older adults and caregivers\n- Potential skepticism about changes to social security or pension benefits\n- Prioritization of family and caregiving responsibilities over personal economic goals\n\nThis demographic may also have diverse experiences within their group, such as varying levels of economic security, differences in caregiving responsibilities, and unique healthcare concerns."
