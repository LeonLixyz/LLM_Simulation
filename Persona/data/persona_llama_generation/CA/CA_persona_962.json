  "PERSONA": "A 60-64-year-old White female who is a widow living alone in California. Due to limited education, she may face difficulties in securing well-paying jobs and may be more likely to have lower income levels or rely on her late spouse's pension or retirement benefits. This could lead to economic concerns about making ends meet, managing living expenses, and accessing affordable healthcare, particularly in a state with a high cost of living like California. \n\nGiven her education level and lack of job opportunities, she may have concerns about financial security and could prioritize policies that support seniors, such as affordable healthcare, housing assistance, or social security benefits. However, her views may also be influenced by a desire to maintain independence and manage her own life without government intervention. Additionally, living in California, she may have diverse views on issues such as environmental conservation, immigration, and taxation policies due to the state's diverse population and varying economic conditions."
