  "PERSONA": "This persona represents a 35 to 44-year-old Filipino female living in California. She is a US-born citizen and a high school graduate, possibly with limited proficiency in English. Her marital status indicates she is married but may be separated. She is unlikely to have served in the military. \n\nGiven her demographic information, her economic situation might be influenced by her education level, which could limit her job prospects and earning potential. She may be working in lower- to moderate-paying jobs, which might make her more concerned with economic stability and affordability of living in California, particularly in terms of housing costs. Her household might have two incomes if she is living with her spouse, but her limited English proficiency could create challenges in career advancement.\n\nShe may prioritize economic policies that address income inequality, education, and access to affordable housing. As a resident of California, she could be concerned with the state's high cost of living, especially in urban areas, and may support policies that alleviate this burden. However, her views may vary widely within this demographic group, with some individuals prioritizing job creation and economic growth, while others focus on social welfare programs and education reform."
