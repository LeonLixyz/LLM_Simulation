  "PERSONA": "This individual is a 65 to 74-year-old Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity, residing in California. As a high school graduate, she likely has a moderate level of education, which may influence her career prospects and economic situation. \n\nGiven her age, she is likely retired or nearing retirement, and her economic concerns may revolve around Social Security, pension, and healthcare. As someone who has never married, she may have fewer family responsibilities but could be more reliant on her personal savings or retirement funds. \n\nLiving with relatives, possibly as an 'other relative of the household,' might indicate that she values family ties or requires support. Her English proficiency and US citizenship could facilitate access to social services and government programs. \n\nPotential economic concerns for this demographic include:\n\n- Healthcare costs and accessibility\n- Retirement savings and financial security\n- Social Security benefits and potential changes\n- Housing affordability, especially in high-cost areas like California\n- Access to affordable healthcare and long-term care options\n\nPossible viewpoints or concerns:\n\n- May prioritize healthcare and social services funding\n- Could be concerned about the impact of immigration policies on family members or community\n- Might support policies promoting affordable housing and retirement security\n- May value education and job training programs for younger generations\n- Could be interested in environmental policies, given California's emphasis on sustainability"
