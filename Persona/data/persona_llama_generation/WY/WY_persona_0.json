She is married to her husband, Ryan, a fellow veteran whom she met while serving in the US Army. They currently reside in a cozy, two-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne, with a monthly rent of $1,200. Alex is a high school graduate, having completed her diploma from a public school in a different state before enlisting in the military.\n\nAs a veteran, Alex leverages her experience and skills to excel in her sales role, earning an annual income of $62,500. Her job provides private health insurance, which covers her and her husband. Ryan, who is currently pursuing a degree in environmental science, works part-time as a park ranger, supplementing their household income.\n\nAlex's family dynamic is close-knit, and she is particularly close to her younger brother, who lives with them temporarily while attending community college. Her parents, both retired, reside in a nearby town and often visit for family gatherings. Alex's economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off student loans, and planning for her brother's education expenses.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking, fishing, and volunteering at local conservation events. She values her community and is interested in local politics, particularly policies affecting veterans, education, and environmental conservation. As a sales representative, Alex is keenly aware of consumer trends and the impact of economic policies on small businesses and local economies. Her experiences as a veteran and a young adult in Wyoming shape her views on issues like access to healthcare, education, and job opportunities."
