  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old White female living in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan, but they have chosen not to live together yet due to her education and career pursuits. Alex resides with her parents in a modest, three-bedroom house on the outskirts of town. \n\nAlex is a US-born citizen, originally from Cheyenne, Wyoming, but her family moved to Lander when she was 10 years old. She graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Technology from the University of Wyoming in Laramie. Her educational background has led her to secure a job as a Quality Control Specialist at a local manufacturing plant, where she works 40 hours a week, earning $42,500 per year. She has private health insurance through her employer.\n\nAs a child living with her parents, Alex contributes $500 monthly to the household income, which helps with mortgage payments and living expenses. Her parents, both in their late 50s, appreciate the financial assistance. Her father works as a mechanic, and her mother is a part-time librarian. Alex's household is considered middle-class, with a combined income of around $80,000 per year.\n\nAlex's economic concerns revolve around saving for a down payment on a house, paying off her student loans, and planning for her future with Ryan. They intend to start a family within the next few years and want to ensure they can provide a stable life for their children. She is interested in local and national policies that support affordable housing, education, and job opportunities, as these directly impact her life and future plans.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors with Ryan and their two dogs, often visiting the nearby Shoshone National Forest. She values community involvement and volunteers at the local animal shelter, reflecting her compassionate and socially responsible personality."
