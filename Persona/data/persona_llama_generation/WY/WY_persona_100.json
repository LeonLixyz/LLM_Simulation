  "PERSONA": "A 29-year-old Hispanic female, who identifies as \"Other Hispanic or Latino\" due to her mixed Ecuadorian and Puerto Rican heritage, reflecting the diversity within the Hispanic community. She is married to her high school sweetheart and lives in the town of Laramie, Wyoming, where she was born and raised. \n\nShe holds a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained after completing her undergraduate degree in Marketing. This educational background has served her well in her current career as a Sales Representative for a local outdoor gear company, where she has worked for the past four years. Her job involves promoting and selling camping equipment to retailers across the western United States. She takes pride in her work, often attending trade shows and building relationships with clients. \n\nHer household consists of her husband, who works as an engineer for a local firm, and their two-year-old daughter. They rent a two-bedroom house in a family-friendly neighborhood close to the University of Wyoming campus. The neighborhood is known for its mix of young families and students, with several parks and playgrounds nearby. They pay $1,200 per month in rent, which is relatively affordable given the local cost of living.\n\nThe family has private health insurance through her husband's employer, which covers their daughter as well. They also have a modest savings plan in place, aiming to save enough for a down payment on a house within the next five years. Her annual income is $42,000, while her husband earns around $60,000, providing them with a combined household income that allows for some discretionary spending on outdoor activities and travel.\n\nGiven her career and family responsibilities, she is particularly concerned about economic policies that impact access to affordable childcare and education. She also follows local economic development initiatives closely, as they can affect her job security and the overall quality of life in Laramie. As a sales professional, she is keenly aware of the importance of a strong local economy and its ripple effects on businesses like hers."
