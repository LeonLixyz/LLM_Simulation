  "PERSONA": "Meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She shares a two-bedroom apartment with two roommates in a relatively affordable neighborhood near downtown, with a monthly rent of $1,200 split three ways. Alex is married to her high school sweetheart, who works as a mechanic at a local garage. They met in their junior year of high school in Colorado, where Alex was born and raised, and got married shortly after graduation.\n\nAlex is a high school graduate with a strong background in business and computer applications. She decided not to pursue higher education immediately after high school, opting instead to gain work experience and save money for potential future studies. Her current job as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company pays $85,000 annually, which is a significant contribution to her household income.\n\nGiven her income and public insurance coverage through her employer, Alex's primary economic concerns revolve around saving for a down payment on a house and navigating the complexities of married life on a dual-income budget. She and her husband aim to purchase a home within the next three years, which would require significant savings and smart financial planning.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex is deeply aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and the fluctuations in employment opportunities that come with it. Her husband's job security is often a topic of discussion, given the volatile nature of the mechanic industry. However, Alex's own job in the insurance sector provides a sense of stability, allowing her to plan for their future with some degree of certainty.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys exploring the outdoors with her husband and their friends, taking advantage of Wyoming's vast natural landscapes. She is also an avid reader and participates in a local book club, which she finds helps her stay connected to her community and engaged in discussions about social and political issues."
