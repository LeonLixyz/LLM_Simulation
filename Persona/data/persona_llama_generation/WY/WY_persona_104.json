  "PERSONA": "Meet Maya, a 49-year-old American Indian woman of Aztec ethnicity. Born in New Mexico, Maya moved to Wyoming about 10 years ago to live with her husband's family. She is now married to her second husband, Julian, who is also of Native American descent. Maya's relationship with Julian's family is close, and she has become an integral part of the household, helping with family responsibilities and care for Julian's elderly mother, who owns the house they all live in together.\n\nMaya's educational background includes two years of study in environmental science at the University of New Mexico. Although she didn't complete her degree, her time in college sparked a deep interest in sustainability and conservation. Before moving to Wyoming, Maya worked as a part-time park ranger in New Mexico, which she loved for its connection to the outdoors and her heritage. However, she had to leave the job due to limited career advancement opportunities and a desire to support Julian's career as a wildlife biologist in Wyoming.\n\nCurrently, Maya works as an administrative assistant at a local non-profit organization focused on environmental conservation and education in Wyoming. Her annual income is around $38,000, which, combined with Julian's income as a biologist, allows them to contribute to the household expenses and enjoy a modest lifestyle.\n\nThe household, located in a rural area near Lander, Wyoming, is a spacious, three-bedroom house that has been in Julian's family for generations. Maya and Julian are considering starting a family of their own but are cautious due to financial concerns and the desire to ensure they can provide a stable and secure environment for their future children.\n\nMaya is fluent in English and has a deep appreciation for her Aztec heritage, often participating in local cultural events and sharing stories of her ancestors with Julian's family. Her economic concerns include access to quality education, healthcare, and environmental conservation efforts that directly impact her community and the land she loves. Maya's political views are shaped by her connection to the land and her desire to preserve it for future generations, while also ensuring economic stability and opportunities for her community."
