  "PERSONA": "Meet Carolyn Thompson, a 57-year-old White female who resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She lives with her parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood near the city center. Carolyn is married to her husband, Tom, whom she met while pursuing her Master's degree in Environmental Science. They have been married for 27 years but are currently separated due to Tom's job relocation to Denver, Colorado. Despite the physical distance, they remain committed to their relationship and are working towards reunification.\n\nCarolyn holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming and has been working as an Environmental Consultant for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality for the past 20 years. Her annual income is $73,000. She is fluent in English, having been born and raised in the United States, specifically in Wyoming.\n\nCarolyn's living situation is a result of her parents' need for assistance due to their advanced age. Her father, 82, and mother, 80, both suffer from chronic health conditions, and Carolyn has taken on a caregiving role to support them. This arrangement also helps alleviate some of the financial burden associated with caregiving, as Carolyn contributes to the household income and helps with mortgage payments on their $250,000 family home.\n\nGiven her background in environmental science and her work experience, Carolyn is deeply concerned about climate change and its impact on local ecosystems. Her economic concerns revolve around the potential effects of environmental policies on the local economy, particularly in the energy sector, which is a significant contributor to Wyoming's economy. She is also worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact on her parents' well-being and her own financial stability.\n\nCarolyn's educational background and career trajectory have instilled in her a strong appreciation for the importance of science-based decision-making in policy development. As a result, she tends to support policies that prioritize environmental sustainability and evidence-based decision-making."
