  "PERSONA": "Emily Hernandez, an 87-year-old female, lives in a rural area of Wyoming with her 92-year-old mother. She has never married and does not have any children of her own. Her father passed away when she was in her early 20s. Emily is of mixed Native American and Spanish ancestry, but due to the lack of specific ethnic data, it is assumed that she identifies more with her Native American heritage, given Wyoming's historical context and her birth in a different state, likely one with a significant Native American population such as Arizona or New Mexico. She is a US citizen by birth, born in Arizona, and moved to Wyoming with her family during her teenage years due to her father's job relocation. Her mother, being the primary caregiver, now relies on Emily for daily support due to her advanced age.\n\nEmily graduated from high school in Wyoming and pursued vocational training in bookkeeping. She worked for over three decades as a bookkeeper for a local business in her town, retiring at the age of 65. Her annual retirement income is approximately $35,000, comprising her Social Security benefits and a small pension from her employer. Emily owns the house she lives in, which was inherited from her father, and thus does not pay a mortgage. However, she does pay property taxes and maintenance costs. Given her rural location, internet access is limited, and she relies on a landline phone for communication.\n\nEmily's economic concerns include the rising costs of healthcare, especially for seniors, and the increasing property taxes in her area, which strain her fixed income. She also worries about the lack of accessible public transportation in her rural community, which affects her ability to visit friends and access healthcare services without relying on others. Her political priorities include support for policies that address these issues, particularly those that aim to reduce the financial burden on seniors and improve rural infrastructure.\n\nEmily's educational background and career path reflect a practical approach to securing stable employment. Her experience living with and caring for her elderly mother has also shaped her views on healthcare and social support for the elderly. Living in a rural area with limited access to services influences her political views, particularly concerning infrastructure and healthcare accessibility."
