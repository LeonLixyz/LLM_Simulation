  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, an 18-year-old male, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. He is a high school graduate, having recently completed his education at a public high school in Casper, the second-largest city in Wyoming. Ethan lives alone in a rented studio apartment in a modest neighborhood, with a monthly rent of $800. As the primary householder, he is responsible for all living expenses.\n\nEthan works as a part-time sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, earning a gross income of $18,000 per year. His job requires him to work approximately 25 hours per week, with variable shifts, including weekends. Ethan's economic situation is relatively stable, but he has to be mindful of his expenses, as he is his only source of financial support.\n\nEthan's education has provided him with a solid foundation in general subjects, but he did not pursue higher education due to financial constraints and a desire to enter the workforce immediately. His high school diploma has been sufficient for his current job, but he may face limitations in career advancement without further education or specialized training.\n\nAs a single male without kids, Ethan's family structure is straightforward, with no dependents to support. However, he does have a close relationship with his parents, who live in a nearby town and provide emotional support when needed.\n\nEthan's geographic location in Casper, Wyoming, means he is influenced by the local economy, which is heavily reliant on the energy and agriculture industries. He is concerned about the economic implications of fluctuations in these sectors and the potential impact on his job security. Ethan's economic priorities include saving for a car, paying off student loans (although minimal, as he did not attend college), and building an emergency fund to cushion against unexpected expenses.\n\nEthan's language proficiency in English is excellent, having spoken it as his primary language since birth. He does not speak any other languages fluently, although he has basic knowledge of Spanish from his high school courses. As a US citizen born in Wyoming, Ethan feels a strong connection to his community and is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to economic development, education, and environmental conservation."
