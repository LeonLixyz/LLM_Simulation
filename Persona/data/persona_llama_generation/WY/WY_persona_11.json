  "PERSONA": "Meet Rohini \"Ro\" Jensen, a 38-year-old married woman living in Jackson, Wyoming, with her husband, Erik, and their two children, ages 7 and 9. Born in Mumbai, India, Rohini immigrated to the United States with her family at the age of 10 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in her early 20s. She resides with her parents, who own a modest home in a suburban neighborhood, due to the high cost of living in Jackson.\n\nRohini has an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education from a local community college, which she completed before deciding to pursue a career in education. She works as a kindergarten teacher at a public elementary school in Teton County School District, earning a salary of $220,000 per year, supplemented by her husband's income as a freelance writer. Erik's variable income, however, makes it challenging for the family to budget and plan for the future.\n\nDespite their combined income, the Jensens struggle to afford health insurance, opting to go without coverage due to the high premiums. They prioritize their children's education and extracurricular activities, often relying on their extended family for support.\n\nRohini's parents, who are in their early sixties, are retired and live on a fixed income. They own their home, which has appreciated significantly in value due to Jackson's growing popularity as a tourist destination. Rohini's father, a retired engineer, helps with childcare and household chores, allowing Rohini to balance her career and family responsibilities.\n\nThe Jensens are concerned about the rising cost of living in Jackson, particularly the increasing housing costs and the impact of gentrification on the local community. They worry about their children's future and the affordability of higher education. Rohini is also passionate about education policy and advocates for increased funding for public schools and affordable childcare options.\n\nIn her free time, Rohini enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors with her family, as well as practicing yoga and reading. She is active in her community, volunteering at the local library and participating in parent-teacher association meetings."
