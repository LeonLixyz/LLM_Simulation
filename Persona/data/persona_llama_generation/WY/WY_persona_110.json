  "PERSONA": "Diane Wilson is a 68-year-old white female, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. She is the primary householder of a single-parent household with two children, ages 19 and 21, both of whom are currently attending community college. Diane has never been married and has been the sole breadwinner for her family since the birth of her first child. \n\nDiane has some college education, having attended a local community college for two years before dropping out to care for her children. Despite not having a degree, she has been able to secure a stable job as a medical administrative assistant at a small clinic in her hometown of Casper, Wyoming. Her annual income is approximately $42,000, which allows her to afford a modest three-bedroom house with a mortgage of $800 per month.\n\nAs a single mother, Diane's economic concerns are centered around providing for her children's education and ensuring they have a better life than she did. She is proud of her children's academic achievements and is working hard to save enough for their future college expenses. Diane's economic priorities include affordable healthcare, education, and job security. She is worried about the rising costs of living in Wyoming and the impact it may have on her family's well-being.\n\nDiane speaks English fluently and has no known language barriers. She is a US citizen and has always resided in Wyoming, which has instilled in her a strong sense of community and loyalty to her hometown. As a result, Diane is invested in local politics and is particularly interested in policies that support small businesses, education, and healthcare in rural areas.\n\nIn her free time, Diane enjoys volunteering at local community events and spending time with her family. She is proud of her independence and self-sufficiency but acknowledges the challenges of being a single mother in a rural area. Diane's experiences have shaped her economic and political views, making her a strong advocate for policies that support working-class families and rural communities."
