  "PERSONA": "Ana G\u00f3mez, a 49-year-old Mexican woman, born in Manila, Philippines, to Mexican parents who were expatriates at the time. She is the primary householder of a married-couple household in a small town in Wyoming, where she resides with her long-term partner, Carlos, whom she has been in a committed relationship with for over 15 years but has chosen not to marry.\n\nAna's educational background includes completing two years at a community college in California, studying business administration, before deciding not to pursue a degree due to financial constraints. Despite this, she has managed to build a successful career in the hospitality sector, currently working as an assistant manager at a local hotel in Wyoming, earning an annual income of $52,000. Carlos, her partner, works as a mechanic, bringing home an additional $45,000 per year.\n\nThe couple rents a modest two-bedroom apartment in a mixed-income neighborhood, with a monthly rent of $900. They have chosen not to buy a home due to the uncertainty of their immigration status and the financial implications of such a significant investment.\n\nAna's immigration status as a non-U.S. citizen impacts many of her economic and political views. She is particularly concerned about pathways to citizenship and the potential for immigration reform that could secure her future in the country she has called home for over 20 years. Her economic concerns include access to affordable healthcare, workers' rights, and the cost of living, especially in a state like Wyoming where certain services and goods can be more expensive due to its rural nature.\n\nAna speaks English well, having learned it as a necessity for her career advancement and integration into American society. However, she maintains strong ties to her Mexican heritage, celebrating traditional holidays and cooking Mexican dishes regularly. Despite her long-term relationship, Ana has never married, partly due to her personal beliefs and partly because of the complexities her immigration status could introduce into the process.\n\nAna's experiences as a foreign-born individual, her career trajectory, and her personal choices have shaped her perspectives on economic and political issues, focusing on stability, equality, and the pursuit of a secure future in the United States."
