  "PERSONA": "Meet 79-year-old Maria Rodriguez, a widowed US-born citizen living in a small town in Wyoming. Maria is of White racial background and identifies as non-Hispanic White, given the null ethnicity and her birthplace. Maria lives with her 95-year-old mother, for whom she is the primary caregiver, in a single-family home that has been in their family for over 40 years. The home, located in a quiet suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, is fully paid off, alleviating Maria of mortgage payments but leaving her to manage maintenance and property taxes.\n\nAssuming a non-traditional household structure due to the null household type and her living situation, Maria and her mother share the household responsibilities. Maria is fluent in Spanish but also speaks English well, which she learned in school and has maintained through her community engagements. Her educational background includes some college credits, primarily in healthcare and social services, which she pursued part-time while raising her family. However, she never completed her degree.\n\nMaria's late husband was a veteran, but she is not a veteran herself. Before his passing, they worked together, managing a small, family-owned convenience store. Maria's income is now primarily composed of her late husband's pension, her mother's social security benefits, and a small part-time income from working as a part-time caregiver for neighbors who need assistance. Her annual household income is approximately $55,000.\n\nGiven her situation, Maria's economic concerns are centered around ensuring her mother's healthcare needs are met, managing the upkeep of their home, and maintaining their current standard of living amidst rising living costs in Wyoming. She is particularly interested in policies affecting senior citizens, veterans' benefits, healthcare accessibility, and property tax relief for seniors. Maria is an active member of her local senior center, where she participates in advocacy groups for senior citizens and veterans' families."
