  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 62-year-old white female, a veteran of the US Army, and a long-term resident of Wyoming. She lives in a small town in the county of Teton, near Jackson Hole, with her spouse, John, whom she met while working as a park ranger in the Grand Teton National Park. They share a modest, two-story house built in the 1990s, which they own, with a mortgage close to being fully paid off.\n\nAlex holds a master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she earned after serving in the US Army for six years as a logistics officer. She was honorably discharged with the rank of captain. Her graduate education and military experience led her to a career as a environmental consultant, working for a small firm in Jackson that focuses on sustainable development and conservation projects in the region.\n\nAs a spouse of the household, Alex is not the primary breadwinner; however, her income significantly contributes to the household. Her annual salary is around $65,000, supplementing her spouse's income as a high school teacher. Together, they have a combined household income of about $120,000.\n\nDespite their comfortable income, Alex and her spouse are cautious about their finances, having experienced economic downturns in Wyoming's tourism and energy sectors. Their primary economic concerns are maintaining their lifestyle in retirement, ensuring they can support their aging parents, and dealing with the rising cost of living in Teton County, which is experiencing rapid gentrification.\n\nAlex is a lifelong learner, often attending local seminars and workshops on environmental issues and sustainable practices. She is an avid hiker and volunteers for the Teton County Parks and Recreation Department, reflecting her deep connection to the natural beauty of Wyoming.\n\nAs a veteran and someone who has lived in Wyoming for over three decades, Alex has developed a strong sense of community and local politics. She is particularly interested in policies affecting veterans, environmental conservation, and affordable housing in rural areas. Her political views are moderate, leaning towards conservative on fiscal issues but liberal on social and environmental matters, reflecting the complexities of living in a state with a strong tradition of individual freedom and a growing need for sustainable development."
