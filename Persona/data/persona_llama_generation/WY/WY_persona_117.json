  "PERSONA": "Alejandro Morales, a 28-year-old male, lives in Casper, Wyoming, with his wife, Rachel, and two housemates in a shared, three-bedroom rental house near downtown. Alejandro was born in Denver, Colorado, but has lived in Wyoming for about five years. He identifies as \"Some Other Race\" due to his mixed Latin American heritage, though he does not specify further.\n\nAlejandro is a high school graduate from Denver, where he was raised by his parents. He moved to Wyoming for work opportunities, particularly in the oil and gas industry, which has a significant presence in the state. He currently works as an Operations Coordinator for a mid-sized oil services company, earning approximately $55,000 annually. His wife, Rachel, works part-time as a nurse at a local hospital, and together they have a combined household income of about $80,000.\n\nAlejandro and Rachel got married two years ago in a small ceremony in Casper, surrounded by close friends and family. They do not have any children yet but are considering starting a family soon. Alejandro is a non-veteran and does not have any immediate family members who have served in the military.\n\nIn his free time, Alejandro enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing, which Wyoming's vast natural landscapes offer in abundance. He speaks English fluently and has no known language barriers. Alejandro's primary economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, as he and Rachel currently rent for $1,200 per month, and planning for the future costs of raising a family."
