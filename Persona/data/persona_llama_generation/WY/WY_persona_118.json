  "PERSONA": "Meet Harold \"Hank\" Thompson, an 87-year-old male of mixed White and American Indian heritage. Hank was born in the state of Wyoming, where he has spent most of his life. He resides in a homeless shelter in the city of Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital, due to a series of unfortunate events that led to the loss of his home.\n\nHank holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he earned in 1960. After college, he worked as a wildlife biologist for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department for over 30 years, retiring in 1995. His career allowed him to work closely with local Native American communities, fostering a deep appreciation for their culture and traditions.\n\nDespite his age, Hank remains married to his wife, Margaret, whom he met in college. They have been married for 58 years but have been separated for the past three years due to Hank's increasing need for full-time care. Margaret resides in a nearby assisted living facility, and Hank visits her regularly.\n\nHank's economic situation is precarious, relying on a modest pension from his work as a wildlife biologist and a small Social Security check. He struggles to make ends meet, often relying on local food banks and charities to get by. His experience with homelessness has made him acutely aware of the need for affordable housing and social services for seniors.\n\nGiven his background and current circumstances, Hank's primary economic concerns revolve around affordable healthcare, social security, and housing support for seniors. He believes in the importance of preserving the natural environment and is worried about the impact of climate change on local ecosystems. Hank's experiences have also made him an advocate for increased funding for social services, particularly those catering to the elderly and homeless populations.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of Wyoming, Hank is deeply rooted in the state's culture and community. He is proud of his mixed heritage and feels a strong connection to the land and its indigenous people. Despite the challenges he faces, Hank remains optimistic and continues to engage with his community, sharing his knowledge and experience with others whenever possible."
