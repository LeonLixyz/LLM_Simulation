  "PERSONA": "Emily Thompson is a 62-year-old white female, married for over 30 years to her high school sweetheart, John. Born in rural Ohio, Emily moved to Wyoming 25 years ago with her husband, who worked as a mechanic in the oil industry. They settled in the small town of Casper, where they raised two children, both of whom have moved out of state for college and careers. Emily graduated from high school but did not pursue higher education, focusing instead on raising her family and managing the household. Her husband's income and benefits provided for the family's needs, allowing Emily to stay out of the workforce and focus on domestic duties.\n\nThe couple owns a modest, single-family home in a quiet neighborhood near the Casper River, purchased in 2002 for $120,000. Emily's husband is now semi-retired, working part-time as a handyman, and Emily is not in the labor force, having dedicated her life to family care. Their combined annual income is $22,000, which includes John's part-time earnings and Emily's social security benefits. They rely on Medicare for health insurance.\n\nEmily's economic concerns revolve around maintaining their modest lifestyle on a fixed income, ensuring they can afford medication and healthcare costs, and keeping their home, which is their primary asset. She is worried about potential cuts to social security and Medicare, as these programs are crucial to their financial stability. Emily and her husband are conservative in their spending habits, preferring to save for unexpected expenses rather than accumulate debt. They prioritize local shopping and community involvement, valuing the small-town feel of Casper.\n\nEmily's daily life revolves around her family, gardening, and volunteering at the local animal shelter. She is an avid reader and enjoys cooking for her family and friends. Emily and her husband are proud of their children's accomplishments and look forward to visits from their grandchildren. Despite the economic challenges they face, Emily feels grateful for the life they have built and is committed to making the most of their golden years."
