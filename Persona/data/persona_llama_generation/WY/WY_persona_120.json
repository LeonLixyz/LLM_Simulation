  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Ryan Thompson, a white male living in the small town of Jackson, Wyoming. Ryan resides with his parents in a single-family home in a rural area just outside the town center. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Emily, whom he met while attending Jackson Hole High School. Emily works as a part-time nurse at the local hospital, and they have two children together, aged 6 and 8, who attend the local elementary school.\n\nRyan attended Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming, where he studied business administration but did not complete his degree due to financial constraints. Instead, he took over his family's small construction business, which specializes in custom home building and renovation. The business has been moderately successful, allowing Ryan to provide for his family and contribute to the local economy. His annual household income is around $65,000, with his wife contributing an additional $30,000 from her part-time job.\n\nAs a homeowner with a mortgage, Ryan is concerned about the rising cost of living in Jackson, particularly the increasing property taxes and the impact of tourism on the local housing market. He values affordable healthcare and education, which is reflected in his support for local policies that promote these services. Ryan is also passionate about environmental conservation, given the natural beauty of his surroundings, and advocates for sustainable development practices in his community.\n\nRyan's family responsibilities, combined with his business and community involvement, shape his economic and political views. He prioritizes issues that directly affect his family's well-being and the local economy, such as access to affordable healthcare, quality education, and job creation. His experiences as a small business owner and a member of the local community also influence his opinions on regulations, taxation, and environmental policies.\n\nAssumptions made based on the provided metadata include:\n\n- Ethnicity: Given the lack of information on ethnicity, it is assumed that Ryan identifies as non-Hispanic white, which is the dominant ethnic group in Wyoming.\n- HOUSEHOLD_TYPE: Based on Ryan's age, marital status, and the fact that he lives with his parents, it is assumed that he resides in a single-family home with his parents and his own family.\n- Birthplace within Wyoming: Given the \"BIRTH_DETAIL\" field indicates \"State of residence,\" it is assumed that Ryan was born in Wyoming, possibly in the same town where he currently resides."
