  "PERSONA": "Meet Jorge Antonio Morales, a 67-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Wyoming, Jorge is a lifelong resident of the state and has been married to his wife, Maria, for 40 years. They have two grown children who have moved out of the house, but Jorge's 90-year-old mother, Ana, lives with them due to health concerns, which classifies their household as \"Child living with Parents.\" Jorge and his wife care for Ana, managing her daily needs and ensuring her well-being.\n\nJorge attended Laramie County Community College for two years, studying business administration but did not complete his degree due to financial constraints. He speaks English fluently, having grown up in the United States. Jorge's education background has significantly influenced his career trajectory. He works as a part-time bookkeeper for a small, local construction firm in Cheyenne, earning $42,000 annually. His wife, Maria, is a retired elementary school teacher, and their combined income allows them to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nJorge and Maria own a modest, single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood in Cheyenne, which they purchased in 1985 for $120,000. The current value of their home is approximately $280,000. They have a mortgage of $80,000, with a monthly payment of $600. They also have two cars: a 2015 Honda Civic for Jorge and a 2018 Toyota RAV4 for Maria.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Jorge does not receive any veteran benefits, but he and Maria are eligible for Medicare. Jorge's primary economic concerns are ensuring his mother's healthcare needs are met and saving for their retirement. He is keenly interested in local politics, particularly policies affecting healthcare, education, and property taxes. Jorge and Maria are active in their community, volunteering at the local food bank and participating in neighborhood events."
