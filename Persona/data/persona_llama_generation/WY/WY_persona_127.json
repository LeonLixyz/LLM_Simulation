  "PERSONA": "Meet Emily Wong, a 49-year-old woman of mixed White and Asian descent, residing in the suburban area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She lives with her husband, Tom, and her 72-year-old mother, who owns the house they all share. Emily's mother, a retired teacher, purchased the home in the late 1990s, and Emily has been living there since her marriage in 2005.\n\nEmily is a high school graduate, having attended Cheyenne's Central High School. After completing her education, she worked various part-time jobs, eventually landing a full-time position as a receptionist at a local dental clinic. She has been working there for 12 years, earning a steady income of $42,000 per year.\n\nEmily is married to Tom, a 51-year-old who works as a mechanic at a local car dealership. They met through mutual friends and have been married for 17 years. Tom earns a slightly higher income than Emily, around $55,000 per year. Together, they contribute to the household expenses, including the mortgage payments, which Emily's mother still pays the majority of.\n\nEmily's economic concerns revolve around saving for retirement, as she feels that her current income might not be enough to sustain her and her husband in the long term. She is also worried about her mother's health and the potential need to take on more caregiving responsibilities in the future.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, Emily is focused on paying off her credit card debt, which she accumulated during a period of unemployment a few years ago. She is also interested in exploring ways to invest in her retirement, possibly through a 401(k) or IRA.\n\nGiven her background and current situation, Emily is likely to be concerned about issues related to healthcare, social security, and economic stability. She may be more inclined to support policies that promote affordable healthcare, protect social security benefits, and provide opportunities for economic growth and job creation in her local community."
