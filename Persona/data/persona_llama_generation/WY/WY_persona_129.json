  "PERSONA": "Meet John, a 62-year-old male living in the state of Wyoming. He identifies as White and Some Other Race, with no specified ethnicity. John resides in a household with his parents, indicating he has never left the family home, possibly due to various life circumstances or personal preferences. We assume his household type to be a single-family home, given his living situation.\n\nJohn has never been married and does not have any children. He is not a veteran, having never served in the armed forces. He speaks English as his primary language and has a high level of proficiency. Born in a different state, John is a US citizen who has relocated to Wyoming at some point in his life.\n\nJohn holds a graduate degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming. His educational background has equipped him with a strong foundation in environmental policy and conservation. He works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm in Cheyenne, the state capital, with an annual income of around $65,000. This role allows him to apply his knowledge to real-world problems and contribute to the preservation of Wyoming's natural beauty.\n\nAs a renter, John pays approximately $1,200 per month for a modest two-bedroom apartment in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. His economic concerns include the rising costs of living, particularly healthcare and housing, which might impact his ability to maintain his current lifestyle. John's priorities include access to quality, affordable healthcare and policies supporting environmental conservation in Wyoming.\n\nGiven his background and current situation, John may lean towards politicians who prioritize environmental protection, affordable healthcare, and social support for individuals with non-traditional family arrangements or living situations. His economic views might favor a mix of conservative fiscal policies, given his stable income, and progressive social policies that address his concerns about healthcare and environmental protection."
