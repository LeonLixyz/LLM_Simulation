  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 29-year-old white female, married but currently separated, living in a single-family household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder and a high school graduate, born in Wyoming, and a US citizen. Alex speaks English fluently and has public health insurance coverage.\n\nAlex's household income is $82,000, which she receives from investments and her husband's alimony payments. Although she is not currently in the labor force, she previously worked as a part-time administrative assistant at a local non-profit organization before her separation. Her husband, a former oil rig worker, has been providing financial support as part of their separation agreement.\n\nAlex resides in a modest, two-bedroom home in a suburban neighborhood, which she owns outright, having inherited it from her late grandmother. The neighborhood is relatively safe, with a mix of young families and retirees, and is located near a local park and schools.\n\nAlex's educational background has influenced her career trajectory; she had initially planned to attend community college but decided to enter the workforce immediately after high school to support her family. Her experience as an administrative assistant has provided her with valuable organizational skills, but she feels underutilized and is considering further education or training to enhance her job prospects.\n\nAs a non-working individual with a relatively high household income, Alex's economic concerns revolve around financial security and managing her investments wisely. She is also concerned about access to affordable healthcare, particularly given her reliance on public insurance coverage. Her experience with separation has also made her more aware of the importance of financial independence and planning for the future.\n\nAlex's specific economic priorities include saving for retirement, paying off debts, and potentially starting her own business. Her political views tend to lean towards conservative, given Wyoming's predominantly Republican voting record, but she is also drawn to policies that support education, healthcare, and women's rights."
