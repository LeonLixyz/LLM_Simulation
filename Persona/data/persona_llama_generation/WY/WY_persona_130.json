  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 68-year-old white female living in a rural area near Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides with her 92-year-old mother, Margaret, in a single-family home they've owned for over 30 years, which they've modified to accommodate her mother's mobility needs. Emily's father passed away five years ago, and since then, she has been her mother's primary caregiver.\n\nEmily is married to John, 70, a retired rancher who still works part-time as a consultant. They have been married for 45 years and have two children, both of whom have moved out of state for work. Their son, Michael, 42, lives in Denver, Colorado, and works as an environmental engineer, while their daughter, Sarah, 39, is a teacher in Portland, Oregon.\n\nEmily holds an Associate's degree in Nursing from Laramie County Community College, which she earned in 1978. She worked as a registered nurse at Cheyenne Regional Medical Center for over 20 years before retiring in 2008. Her experience in the healthcare sector has given her a strong understanding of the importance of accessible and affordable healthcare, which is a top economic concern for her.\n\nEmily's annual household income is around $55,000, comprising her husband's part-time income, their combined social security benefits, and a small pension from her nursing career. They own their home outright, having paid off the mortgage in 2005. Their monthly expenses are relatively low, but they do worry about the rising costs of healthcare and prescription medications, particularly for her mother's ongoing care.\n\nEmily is fluent in English and has never spoken any other language at home. She is a US citizen by birth, born in Casper, Wyoming, and has always lived in the state. Her economic priorities include protecting social security and Medicare, promoting affordable healthcare, and supporting local businesses and agriculture in Wyoming.\n\nGiven her experience as a caregiver and her background in nursing, Emily is particularly interested in policies that address the needs of the elderly and those requiring long-term care. She also values education and supports policies that improve funding for local schools and community colleges, which she believes are essential for the state's economic development."
