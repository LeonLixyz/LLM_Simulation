As the primary householder, she is married but has been separated for a short period in the past. She is a non-veteran and speaks only English, having been born in the United States and grown up in a predominantly English-speaking household. \n\nShe has attended some college but does not hold a degree, having pursued a course in business administration for two years before deciding to enter the workforce.

Her annual household income is approximately $55,000, with her husband contributing an additional $45,000 as a sales representative for a construction equipment supplier.\n\nThe couple rents a three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, paying $1,200 per month, and are considering saving for a down payment on a house. They have two children, ages 4 and 6, who attend a local public school, and are concerned about the quality of education and the rising costs of childcare.\n\nAs a result of her economic situation, her primary concerns are affordable healthcare, access to quality education for her children, and economic growth in her community. She values job security and is interested in policies that support local businesses and promote economic development in rural areas like Casper."
