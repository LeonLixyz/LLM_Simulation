  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male living in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ryan is married to his wife, Emily, and resides in his parents' household due to financial constraints, which is a common arrangement for many families in Wyoming. Ryan's parents, both in their early sixties, are still working part-time jobs to supplement their retirement income. The household is bilingual, but English is the primary language spoken at home. Ryan's wife, Emily, is currently expecting their first child, and they are looking forward to starting their own family.\n\nRyan holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Laramie County Community College. He has been working as a service manager at a local Ford dealership in Cheyenne for the past six years, earning an annual salary of $52,000. His job provides stable income, health insurance, and a 401(k) plan. Ryan's wife, Emily, is a part-time nurse at Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, working 30 hours a week and earning $35,000 per year. Together, they have a combined household income of $87,000.\n\nRyan was born in Colorado but moved to Wyoming with his family at the age of 10. He has always considered Wyoming his home and values the state's wide open spaces and outdoor recreational opportunities. He is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. Ryan's parents are high school graduates, and he is the first in his family to pursue higher education.\n\nThe Thompsons rent a small apartment in the basement of Ryan's parents' house, paying $600 per month. They plan to save for a down payment on their own home in the next few years. Ryan's primary economic concerns are saving for his child's education, paying off his student loans, and building a stable financial future for his growing family. He is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to education, healthcare, and economic development in Wyoming."
