  "PERSONA": "Robert \"Bob\" Thompson, a 68-year-old White male, lives in a cozy, two-story house in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He has been married to his wife, Susan, for 43 years, and they have two adult children who have moved out of the house. Bob is a high school graduate from his hometown in Ohio, where he was born and raised. After completing his education, he moved to Wyoming for work and has been a resident of the state for over 30 years.\n\nBob works as a semi-retired part-time mechanic at a local car repair shop, earning an annual income of $42,000. He has been in the automotive industry for most of his life, having started as a young apprentice in a garage back in Ohio. Although he has scaled back his work hours, Bob still enjoys tinkering with engines and fixing cars, which he finds therapeutic.\n\nAs a spouse of the household, Bob's wife Susan is the primary breadwinner, working as a librarian at the local library, with an annual income of $55,000. Together, they own their home, which they purchased in 1995 for $120,000. Their current mortgage balance is $30,000, with a monthly payment of $500.\n\nBob and Susan have two adult children, Emily and James, both in their mid-30s. Emily is a teacher, and James works as an engineer. They have three grandchildren who live in the nearby town of Laramie. Bob and Susan enjoy spending time with their family and often take road trips to visit their children and grandchildren.\n\nIn his free time, Bob enjoys fishing, hunting, and outdoor activities that Wyoming's vast wilderness offers. He is a member of the local Elks Lodge and participates in community events, such as the annual Cheyenne Frontier Days.\n\nBob's economic concerns revolve around the rising cost of healthcare, as he and his wife are approaching the age where they will require more medical attention. He is also worried about the impact of inflation on their retirement savings, which they have carefully planned and invested in over the years. As a result, Bob is cautious with their expenses and prioritizes saving for the future.\n\nPolitically, Bob is a moderate conservative who values individual freedom, limited government intervention, and fiscal responsibility. He believes in the importance of community and supports local businesses and initiatives. However, he is skeptical of government programs and regulations that he perceives as overly restrictive or wasteful."
