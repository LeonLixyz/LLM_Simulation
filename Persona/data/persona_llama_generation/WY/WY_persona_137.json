  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hern\u00e1ndez, a 62-year-old white male who lives with his parents in a rural area of Wyoming. Juan is married to his wife, Maria, and they have been together for over 35 years. Despite being married, Juan's living situation is unique due to financial necessity; he resides with his aging parents to help care for them and contribute to household expenses. \n\nJuan was born in New Mexico but has lived in Wyoming for over 20 years. He speaks Spanish at home but has a good grasp of English, which he learned through his years of working in the service industry. His highest level of education is 11th grade, which he completed before dropping out to work and support his family.\n\nJuan works as a maintenance worker at a local resort, earning around $35,000 annually. He has been in this role for over a decade and has developed a strong sense of loyalty to his employer. Despite the physical demands of his job, Juan appreciates the stability it provides, especially in a region with limited job opportunities. \n\nJuan and his wife own a modest mobile home on the outskirts of Cheyenne, which they purchased 15 years ago. Their mortgage is nearly paid off, but they struggle with maintaining the property due to Juan's limited income and Maria's health issues. Maria, who suffers from chronic back pain, is unable to work full-time and relies on part-time, low-wage jobs to supplement their income.\n\nJuan's economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs, particularly for his wife's condition, and the rising costs of living in Wyoming. He worries about the impact of inflation on their fixed income and the potential for job insecurity in the tourism-dependent industry. As a result, Juan tends to be cautious with his finances, prioritizing saving for emergencies and retirement over discretionary spending. \n\nIn terms of politics, Juan is moderate in his views, often prioritizing local issues such as access to affordable healthcare, education, and job creation. He values community and is active in local initiatives to support small businesses and promote economic development in rural Wyoming."
