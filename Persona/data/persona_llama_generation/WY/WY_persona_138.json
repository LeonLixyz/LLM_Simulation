  "PERSONA": "Meet Emily Wilson, a 38-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming. She resides in a single-family home with her parents in a suburban neighborhood. Emily's parents, both in their early sixties, own the house, which has been in the family for over three decades. The house, valued at around $250,000, has a mortgage of approximately $150,000, with her parents making monthly payments of about $1,200.\n\nEmily is a non-veteran, never married, and has no children. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2009. After graduating, she worked as an environmental consultant for a local firm for about five years before transitioning to her current role as an Environmental Program Coordinator for the City of Casper. Her job involves overseeing local sustainability initiatives and coordinating with community groups, earning her a salary of around $52,000 per year.\n\nEmily is fluent in English and was born in Oregon but moved to Wyoming with her family when she was 10 years old. Her parents, both high school graduates, have lived in Wyoming for over 25 years and have instilled in Emily a strong sense of community and environmental stewardship. Emily's economic concerns include affordable housing, access to quality education, and job security in her field. She is particularly concerned about the impact of climate change on local ecosystems and the need for sustainable economic development in Wyoming.\n\nAs a child living with her parents, Emily contributes to the household income and expenses. She pays $800 per month for room and board, which includes utilities and groceries. Emily's monthly expenses also include a car loan payment of $350 for her 2018 Honda Civic, insurance premiums, and miscellaneous expenses. She has a moderate amount of student loan debt, approximately $25,000, which she is paying off gradually.\n\nEmily's living situation allows her to save a significant portion of her income, which she allocates towards retirement, emergency funds, and personal development. She is interested in furthering her education, possibly pursuing a master's degree in environmental policy, and is exploring online courses to enhance her skills in data analysis and project management."
