  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 62-year-old White female, living in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming. She is the primary householder in a cohabiting couple without kids, residing with her partner, Tom, in a modest two-bedroom house they own. Karen is divorced, having been previously married for over 20 years before the couple parted ways due to irreconcilable differences. She has no children from her previous marriage.\n\nKaren was born and raised in Wyoming, specifically in the town of Cheyenne, and has always considered the state her home. She identifies as a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently. Her educational background includes some college education but no degree, having attended the University of Wyoming for two years before dropping out to focus on her career.\n\nAs a result of her education and career path, Karen worked as a dental hygienist for over 25 years before deciding to retire early due to health concerns. Her retirement income is supplemented by her private health insurance, which covers most of her medical expenses. Karen's annual household income falls within the $75,000 to $99,999 range, primarily due to Tom's steady income as a high school teacher in Cody.\n\nKaren and Tom's decision to live in Cody was largely driven by its slower pace of life, scenic beauty, and proximity to outdoor recreational activities. Their home, valued at around $280,000, is situated in a quiet neighborhood with a mix of long-time residents and newcomers. Karen's economic concerns revolve around maintaining her current standard of living, ensuring her retirement savings last, and navigating the complexities of healthcare costs.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Karen is keenly aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and tourism. She worries about the impact of economic downturns on her community and the potential for changes in the healthcare system to affect her insurance coverage. Despite these concerns, Karen remains optimistic about her life in Cody and her ability to enjoy her retirement years in a place she loves."
