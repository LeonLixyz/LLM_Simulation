  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Harold Thompson, a retired mechanic living in Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder of a single-person household, Harold resides in a modest, 1,200-square-foot home he purchased in 1998 for $120,000, which is now valued at $220,000. He has lived in this house for over two decades, accumulating a significant amount of equity. His monthly mortgage payment is $850, which is relatively manageable given his retirement income. \n\nHarold's annual income is $43,000, derived from a combination of his pension ($28,000) and Social Security benefits ($15,000). He also earns an additional $5,000 per year by working part-time at a local auto repair shop, where he has been employed for the past three years.\n\nHarold holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Casper College, which he obtained in 1978. After completing his education, he worked as a mechanic for 30 years at various auto repair shops in Wyoming before retiring in 2010.\n\nHarold is a divorced, non-veteran who was born in Illinois but has lived in Wyoming for most of his life. He is a US citizen and speaks English fluently, with no other languages spoken at home. \n\nAs a single male without kids, Harold's primary economic concerns are maintaining his financial independence, affording healthcare, and ensuring the value of his home does not depreciate. He is particularly worried about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, especially the increasing property taxes and the potential impact of inflation on his fixed income. Harold's economic priorities are centered around preserving his retirement savings and ensuring he can continue to live comfortably in his home without having to downsize or relocate."
