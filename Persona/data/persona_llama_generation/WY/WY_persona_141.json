  "PERSONA": "Meet 22-year-old Ethan Thompson, a Wyoming native living in the small town of Lander with his partner, whom he considers his spouse despite not being formally married. Ethan identifies as a white male and was born in the state of Montana but has lived in Wyoming for most of his life. He speaks English fluently, having grown up in an English-only household, and has never served in the military.\n\nEthan is a high school graduate, having completed his diploma from Lander Valley High School. After high school, he pursued a vocational training program in automotive repair, which led him to his current job as a mechanic at a local car dealership. His annual income is approximately $38,000, which is modest but sufficient for his current lifestyle.\n\nEthan and his partner, Alex, reside in a rented two-bedroom apartment in a relatively new development on the outskirts of Lander. Their rent is $900 per month, which is manageable given their combined income. Ethan's partner works part-time as a server at a local restaurant, bringing in an additional $15,000 per year. They do not have any children, but they do have a pet dog named Max, a Labrador Retriever.\n\nEthan's economic concerns are centered around saving for a down payment on a house, as he and Alex hope to become homeowners within the next five years. He is also interested in furthering his education to specialize in diesel mechanics, which could increase his earning potential. Ethan follows local and national news, particularly stories related to economic development in rural areas and policies affecting small businesses and homeownership. He is registered to vote and participates in local elections, though he does not affiliate strongly with any particular party."
