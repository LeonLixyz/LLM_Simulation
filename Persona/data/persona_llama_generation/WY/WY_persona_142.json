  "PERSONA": "Meet 62-year-old John Wilson, a white male who lives in a rural area of Wyoming with his wife, Susan, in her family's ancestral home. Due to health issues, John moved back in with his 85-year-old parents, George and Margaret, who own the house, a decision made to support his parents and reduce living expenses. John has been married to Susan for over 30 years, and they have two adult children who live elsewhere.\n\nJohn was born in Nebraska but has spent most of his adult life in Wyoming, where he worked as a maintenance supervisor at a local mine until his retirement five years ago. He earned around $55,000 per year before retiring and now lives off his pension and a modest 401(k) savings. Susan, who is 59, works part-time as a librarian at the local school, bringing in an additional $25,000 annually.\n\nJohn attended Casper College for two years, studying mechanical engineering, but did not graduate due to financial constraints. Despite this, he was able to secure a well-paying job at the mine through on-the-job training and experience. He has always been fluent in English, having been born and raised in the United States.\n\nJohn's primary economic concerns are related to healthcare costs, as his parents require constant care, and he is worried about the sustainability of his pension in the face of rising medical expenses. He also worries about the impact of the declining mining industry on local jobs and the community's economic stability. As someone living in a rural area, John is also concerned about access to quality healthcare services and the reliability of internet connectivity, which affects his ability to stay informed about current events and access essential services.\n\nJohn's living situation, with his parents, has influenced his views on social security and healthcare reform, making him more conservative in his economic views, especially concerning government spending and taxation. However, his experience with the challenges of rural living has also made him supportive of government initiatives that improve rural infrastructure and access to essential services."
