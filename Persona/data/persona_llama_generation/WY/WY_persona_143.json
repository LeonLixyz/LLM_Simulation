  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson, a 79-year-old white male of mixed heritage, with a small percentage of Native American ancestry from his mother's side, is the primary householder of a married-couple household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He lives with his 77-year-old wife, Barbara, in a modest, single-story home they own outright in a quiet suburban neighborhood. Harold and Barbara have been married for 55 years, having met in high school in Harold's birth state of Nebraska, where they both grew up. \n\nHarold completed his high school education at Omaha Central High School in Nebraska and did not pursue higher education due to financial constraints and a strong desire to start working to support his family. He moved to Wyoming in his early twenties to work in the mining industry, where he spent over 30 years as a safety inspector before retiring at 62. Harold's wife, Barbara, worked part-time as a librarian until her retirement at 60.\n\nAs a non-veteran and a retiree, Harold's primary income comes from his pension and Social Security benefits, totaling approximately $52,000 annually. His wife also receives a smaller pension from her part-time work and Social Security, contributing around $25,000 to their household income. They have no children and thus no dependents, which allows them to allocate their resources primarily towards their living expenses, travel, and hobbies.\n\nHarold is fluent in English, having spoken it his entire life, and has no proficiency in any other language. He and Barbara enjoy their quiet life in Wyoming, appreciating the outdoor recreational opportunities the state offers. Their economic concerns are mainly centered around healthcare costs and maintaining their standard of living amidst rising living expenses and potential changes to Social Security and Medicare."
