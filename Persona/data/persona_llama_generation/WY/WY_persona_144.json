  "PERSONA": "Meet Carlos Eduardo Hernandez, a 62-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Carlos was born in San Diego, California, but moved to Wyoming for work and to be closer to his long-term partner, Alex, whom he has been with for over 20 years. Despite being in a long-term relationship, Carlos identifies as \"never married,\" as he and Alex have chosen not to formalize their union.\n\nCarlos holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from a community college in California. After working in various auto repair shops in California, he moved to Wyoming to manage a small, independent car repair shop in Cheyenne. He has been working in this position for over a decade, earning a steady income of $55,000 per year. Carlos is proud of his work and takes pride in providing excellent service to his customers.\n\nCarlos speaks English fluently, having grown up in the United States, but he still enjoys speaking Spanish with his family and friends. He has a strong sense of community and is involved in local organizations that promote Hispanic cultural events and support services.\n\nCarlos and Alex own a modest home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they purchased 15 years ago. Their mortgage is nearly paid off, and they are proud of their accomplishment. Carlos's economic concerns center around retirement savings, as he wants to ensure that he and Alex can maintain their lifestyle without financial stress.\n\nCarlos's household income is supplemented by Alex's income as a freelance writer, which averages around $30,000 per year. Together, they have a combined household income of $85,000. Carlos is concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the impact of economic policies on small businesses like his auto repair shop.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Carlos is keenly aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and tourism. He is interested in policies that support small businesses, promote renewable energy, and address the growing need for affordable healthcare. Carlos's unique blend of urban and rural experiences, combined with his long-term relationship and economic concerns, shape his views on economic and political issues."
