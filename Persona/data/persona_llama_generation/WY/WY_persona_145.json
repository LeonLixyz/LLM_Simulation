  "PERSONA": "A 22-year-old female, identifying as White and Native American, living in a household with her parents in a small suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a US citizen, born in Colorado but raised in Wyoming, and is fluent in English, speaking it well. Having never been married, her family consists of her parents and herself, with no siblings at home. She has some college education but does not hold a degree, having attended Laramie County Community College for two years before taking a break to focus on her career and personal life.\n\nShe works part-time as a veterinary assistant at a local animal hospital, earning approximately $25,000 per year. Her job is fulfilling, allowing her to combine her passion for animals with her medical interests. She also volunteers at a nearby wildlife rehabilitation center, which further fuels her desire to one day pursue a degree in veterinary medicine.\n\nAs a veteran, she has served two years in the US Army Reserve, enlisting right after high school. Her military background has instilled discipline and a strong work ethic, which she applies to her daily life. The experience also provided her with valuable medical training and the GI Bill, which she plans to use to further her education in the future.\n\nLiving with her parents allows her to save money, as she does not have to pay rent. However, she contributes to household expenses and is responsible for her own car payment, insurance, and personal expenses. Her parents, both in their early 50s, are supportive of her career goals and encourage her to pursue higher education.\n\nGiven her situation, her primary economic concerns include saving for college, paying off her car loan, and eventually moving into her own place. Politically, she is likely to support policies that promote affordable education, veterans' benefits, and animal welfare."
