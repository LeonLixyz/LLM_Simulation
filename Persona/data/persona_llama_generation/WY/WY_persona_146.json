  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 29-year-old white female, born in the United States, specifically in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2020. Alex is married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan, a 30-year-old who works as a software engineer. Despite being married, Alex still resides with her parents in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, due to the high cost of housing in the area.\n\nAlex works as an environmental consultant for a small firm, earning an annual salary of $55,000. Her job involves assessing the environmental impact of local development projects and providing recommendations for sustainability. She speaks English fluently and has no known disabilities. As a non-veteran, Alex does not have any military background.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex is deeply concerned about the economic implications of environmental policies on her community, particularly in the context of the state's significant fossil fuel industry. Her educational background and professional experience have instilled in her a strong appreciation for sustainable practices, but she also understands the need for economic growth and job creation.\n\nAlex's family structure is relatively traditional, with her parents, both in their late 50s, being high school sweethearts who have lived in Cheyenne their entire lives. Her father works as a mechanic, and her mother is a part-time librarian. Alex's decision to live with her parents is largely driven by financial considerations, as the couple is still paying off student loans and saving for a down payment on a house.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, Alex is most concerned about affordable housing, access to quality education, and job opportunities in her field. She is also passionate about promoting sustainable practices and reducing Wyoming's reliance on fossil fuels. As a resident of a conservative-leaning state, Alex's views on environmental policy are often at odds with those of her community, but she is determined to make a positive impact through her work and advocacy."
