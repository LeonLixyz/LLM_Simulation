  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 29-year-old white male, born in Denver, Colorado, but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ethan is married to his wife, Rachel, whom he met during his graduate studies at the University of Wyoming. They live together in a modest, two-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they purchased three years ago for $270,000. Ethan works as a Data Analyst for the Wyoming State Government, with an annual salary of $65,000. He has a graduate degree in Statistics from the University of Wyoming, which has been instrumental in his career advancement.\n\nEthan's household income is supplemented by his wife's income as a part-time teacher at a local elementary school, bringing their combined annual income to around $90,000. As the primary householder, Ethan is responsible for managing the household finances, which includes a mortgage of $1,800 per month, a car loan, and credit card debt. Despite these expenses, they manage to save around 10% of their income each month.\n\nEthan is fluent in English and has no known disabilities. As a non-veteran, he has never served in the military. Ethan's primary economic concerns include paying off their mortgage, building a stable retirement fund, and potentially starting a family in the near future. His political views are influenced by his experience working in state government, where he has seen firsthand the impact of policy decisions on local communities. He is likely to prioritize issues related to education, affordable housing, and economic development in Wyoming.\n\nEthan and his wife enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking and camping, which Wyoming's natural beauty provides in abundance. They are active members of their local community, volunteering at a nearby animal shelter and participating in neighborhood events. As a couple, they value stability, security, and the opportunity to build a life together in a state they both love."
