  "PERSONA": "Alex Johnson, a 22-year-old white male, lives in Casper, Wyoming, with his 21-year-old wife, Maddie, and their 2-year-old daughter, Emily. As the primary householder, Alex takes his responsibilities seriously, having married Maddie right after high school when she became pregnant. They initially lived with Maddie's parents but moved into a modest, rented two-bedroom apartment ($800/month) in a working-class neighborhood once Alex secured a stable job.\n\nAlex graduated from Natrona County High School and did not pursue higher education due to the need to support his growing family. He works as a sales associate at a local car dealership, earning approximately $35,000 per year. Maddie works part-time as a waitress, contributing about $18,000 annually to their household income. They rely on Medicaid for health insurance and receive SNAP benefits to help with groceries.\n\nTheir daughter, Emily, attends a local daycare, which they struggle to afford ($500/month). Alex and Maddie share a 10-year-old sedan, which they purchased used for $5,000. They have a combined student loan debt of $20,000, mainly from a vocational course Alex took but did not complete.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Alex is keenly aware of the economic fluctuations in the energy industry and its impact on local employment. He worries about job security and the rising costs of living, particularly housing and healthcare. Despite these concerns, Alex is proud of his role as a provider and is committed to creating a better life for his family. His economic priorities include affordable healthcare, stable employment opportunities, and access to quality education for Emily. Politically, Alex leans conservative, influenced by his family's traditional values and the local community's strong Republican presence."
