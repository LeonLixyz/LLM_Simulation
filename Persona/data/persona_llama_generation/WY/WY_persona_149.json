  "PERSONA": "Meet 57-year-old Ryan Thompson, a white male born in Oregon but now residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ryan is married to his wife, Karen, whom he met while working as a heavy equipment mechanic in the construction industry. They do not have any children together, but Ryan has a 25-year-old son from a previous marriage who lives in Oregon.\n\nRyan's educational background includes completing two years at Laramie County Community College in Wyoming, where he studied automotive repair before deciding to enter the workforce directly. This decision was largely driven by the need to support himself and his young son at the time. Despite not having a degree, Ryan's practical skills have allowed him to secure stable employment, currently working for a local construction company as a senior mechanic, earning $62,000 annually.\n\nRyan and his wife Karen live in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in a modest neighborhood in Cheyenne. They pay $900 per month in rent and have been housemates with a 30-year-old coworker of Ryan's for the past three years to split living expenses. Ryan and Karen have been discussing saving up for a down payment on a house but are currently prioritizing paying off their combined $30,000 in student and personal loans.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Ryan's interactions with government services have been limited to typical civilian experiences. He is fluent in English, having been born and raised in the United States, and has never had the need to learn another language. Ryan's economic concerns are centered around job security, managing debt, and the rising cost of living in Wyoming, which he feels is slowly becoming less affordable for working-class individuals.\n\nPolitically, Ryan leans towards policies that support workers' rights, especially in the construction industry, and is concerned about the impact of environmental policies on local jobs. He also prioritizes access to affordable healthcare, having experienced firsthand the financial strain of medical emergencies without adequate insurance coverage. Despite these concerns, Ryan is generally optimistic about the future, focusing on building a secure life for himself and his family in Wyoming."
