  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male living in Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Ryan resides in a modest, rented two-bedroom apartment with his partner, Alex, in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Casper. Despite being listed as \"Never married,\" Ryan and Alex have been in a committed relationship for over a decade and consider themselves a married couple in all but legal terms.\n\nRyan was born in Billings, Montana, but has lived in Wyoming for most of his adult life. He completed his GED after dropping out of high school in the 10th grade and has not pursued further formal education. Ryan's lack of a high school diploma has significantly impacted his career trajectory, leading to limited job opportunities.\n\nCurrently, Ryan is not in the labor force, having stopped working due to health issues. He previously worked as a retail sales associate at a local outdoor gear store but had to leave the job due to chronic back pain. Ryan relies on public health insurance coverage, which has been crucial in managing his condition.\n\nRyan's annual income is approximately $42,500, which he receives through a combination of disability benefits and Alex's income as a part-time accountant. Alex's job provides them with a relatively stable financial foundation, allowing them to afford their rent, groceries, and other living expenses. They do not own a home, as the cost of purchasing a house in Casper is prohibitively expensive for them.\n\nRyan's economic concerns center around healthcare affordability and accessibility, as well as the need for better job opportunities in Wyoming that can accommodate his physical limitations. He is also worried about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly the increasing rent prices, which may force them to seek alternative, more affordable housing options outside of the city.\n\nRyan's political views are shaped by his experiences as a non-traditional family unit and his reliance on public healthcare. He advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, affordable healthcare, and policies that support individuals with disabilities. Ryan is likely to support candidates who prioritize these issues and work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive community in Wyoming."
