  "PERSONA": "Meet Gary Thompson, a 69-year-old White male residing in a small town in Wyoming. As the primary householder, Gary lives with his partner, Mark, in a cozy, two-bedroom house on the outskirts of Cody, a rural town surrounded by the beautiful landscapes of Yellowstone National Park. Despite being listed as \"Never married\" due to the lack of legal recognition of same-sex marriage in their earlier years together, Gary and Mark have been in a committed relationship for over 40 years.\n\nGary holds an Associate's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Casper College, which he obtained in 1978. This educational background led him to a stable career as a maintenance supervisor at a local manufacturing plant, where he worked for 25 years before retiring in 2018 with a modest pension and social security benefits. His annual household income is approximately $55,000, with about $40,000 coming from his retirement benefits and the rest from part-time consulting work he does occasionally.\n\nAs a homeowner, Gary and Mark have lived in their current house for over 20 years, which they purchased for $120,000 in 2002. The house is now valued at around $250,000, providing them with a sense of financial security. However, they are mindful of their expenses, especially healthcare costs, which have become a significant concern as they age. Gary's primary economic concerns include maintaining their standard of living on a fixed income, managing healthcare expenses, and ensuring they can afford any potential long-term care needs.\n\nGary is fluent in English, having been born and raised in the United States, specifically in the state of Nebraska, before moving to Wyoming for college and deciding to stay. He values his American citizenship and the opportunities it has afforded him. Gary's political views are moderate, leaning towards conservative on fiscal issues due to his concern about managing government spending and ensuring financial stability for future generations. However, he is liberal on social issues, supporting LGBTQ+ rights and environmental protection, reflecting his personal experiences and the natural beauty of his surroundings.\n\nGary's daily life is quiet, with time spent gardening, volunteering at a local animal shelter, and enjoying outdoor activities such as hiking and birdwatching. His close-knit community and the natural beauty of Wyoming contribute to his overall sense of well-being and contentment in his retirement."
