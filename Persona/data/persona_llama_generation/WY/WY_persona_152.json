  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 28-year-old White male who lives with his parents in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, Wyoming. Ethan's marital status is widowed, having lost his spouse in a car accident two years ago. Despite the challenges, he continues to reside with his parents due to the financial and emotional support they provide.\n\nEthan holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he completed three years ago. He has been struggling to find a job in his field, partly due to the limited job market in Wyoming. Currently, he works as an Environmental Technician for a local government agency, earning an annual salary of $43,000.\n\nEthan's economic situation is relatively stable, thanks to his parents' support. He contributes $500 monthly towards household expenses, which helps alleviate some of the financial burden on his parents. However, he hopes to move out and become financially independent soon.\n\nAs a child living with his parents, Ethan's household structure is a non-traditional one. His parents, both in their early sixties, are retired and rely on their pension and social security for income. The household income is around $60,000 per year, which is relatively modest for the area.\n\nEthan's primary economic concern is finding a better-paying job in his field to support himself and eventually start a new family. He is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly the increasing housing costs, which makes it difficult for him to save for a down payment on a house.\n\nEthan is a US-born citizen, born in Colorado but raised in Wyoming. He speaks English fluently and has no known disabilities. His veteran status is non-veteran, and he has never served in the military.\n\nAssumptions made based on the provided metadata:\n\n* Household type is assumed to be a single-family home, given the suburban neighborhood location and the fact that Ethan lives with his parents.\n* Ethnicity is assumed to be non-Hispanic, given the lack of information and the fact that the majority of the population in Wyoming is non-Hispanic White.\n\nOverall, Ethan's situation is complex, with both personal and financial challenges. His economic concerns and priorities are shaped by his unique circumstances, including his marital status, job prospects, and living situation."
