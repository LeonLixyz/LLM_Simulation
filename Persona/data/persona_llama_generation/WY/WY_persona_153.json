  "PERSONA": "Margaret \"Margie\" Thompson, a 68-year-old White female, born in Montana, but a long-time resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She lives with her 92-year-old mother, Alice, in a modest, single-story home they own in a quiet neighborhood near the Cheyenne Botanic Gardens. Margie is married to her husband, Richard, a 70-year-old retired mechanic, whom she met while volunteering at the local Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) post. Margie is a veteran herself, having served in the US Army as a medical administrative specialist from 1974 to 1978.\n\nMargie's educational background consists of a high school diploma from Cheyenne Central High School, which she obtained in 1972. After her military service, she worked as a medical records clerk at the Cheyenne VA Medical Center for over 20 years, retiring in 2003. Her annual retirement income is approximately $45,000, supplemented by her husband's retirement income from Social Security and a small pension.\n\nAs a homeowner, Margie and her husband have a mortgage-free home, valued at around $250,000, which they inherited from Richard's parents. They also own a small plot of land outside Cheyenne, where they grow a garden and raise a few chickens.\n\nMargie's primary economic concerns revolve around healthcare and long-term care for her mother, who suffers from dementia. She is worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential need for assisted living or nursing home care in the future. She is also concerned about the impact of inflation on her fixed income and the potential for reduced Social Security benefits.\n\nAs a veteran and a long-time resident of Wyoming, Margie is proud of her community and is actively involved in local veterans' organizations and volunteer work. She values her independence and self-reliance, reflecting the strong Western ethos of her adopted home state. Her political views tend to be conservative, with a focus on fiscal responsibility, national defense, and individual freedom."
