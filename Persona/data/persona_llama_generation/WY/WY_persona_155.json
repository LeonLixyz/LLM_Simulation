  "PERSONA": "Maria Elena Rodriguez is an 87-year-old white female, a US-born citizen, and a resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She lives alone in a single-family home in a quiet, suburban neighborhood, where she has resided for over 20 years. As the primary householder, she is responsible for the mortgage and maintenance of her home, which she has managed to keep up with the help of a modest pension and her social security benefits. \n\nMaria Elena was born in Arizona but moved to Wyoming after her divorce 30 years ago to be closer to her family. She holds a Master's degree in Education from the University of Arizona, which she obtained before her marriage. Her graduate degree led her to a successful teaching career, primarily in Spanish and bilingual education, which she continued in Wyoming until her retirement at the age of 62. \n\nAlthough she speaks Spanish at home and with her family, Maria Elena has a limited proficiency in English, which has occasionally presented challenges in her interactions with local services and healthcare providers. Despite this, she remains active in her community, participating in local senior centers and volunteering at a nearby Hispanic cultural organization.\n\nAs a divorced individual, Maria Elena relies on her retirement savings, pension, and social security benefits, totaling around $42,000 per year. Her economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs, particularly with her age-related health issues, and maintaining her independence. She worries about potential changes to social security and Medicare that could impact her ability to afford her current lifestyle.\n\nMaria Elena's educational background and career have instilled in her a strong appreciation for public education and social services. She values community programs that support seniors and promote cultural diversity. Her economic situation makes her keenly aware of the importance of affordable healthcare and the need for policies that protect social security benefits for seniors like herself."
