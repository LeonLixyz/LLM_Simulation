  "PERSONA": "John \"J.D.\" Davenport, a 38-year-old white male, lives in a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Cheyenne, Wyoming, with his long-term partner, Emily, a 36-year-old freelance graphic designer. As the primary householder, J.D. works as a wind turbine technician at a local renewable energy company, earning approximately $62,000 per year. Born in Portland, Oregon, J.D. moved to Wyoming for college and never left, drawn to the state's wide open spaces and outdoor recreational opportunities.\n\nJ.D. holds an Associate of Applied Science degree in Wind Energy Technology from Laramie County Community College, which has served him well in his career. He has been with his current employer for six years, starting as an entry-level technician and working his way up to a senior role. His job requires frequent travel to wind farms across the state, but he appreciates the challenges and variety that come with the work.\n\nJ.D. and Emily have been together for eight years, having met through mutual friends at a local hiking group. They share a love for the outdoors and try to spend at least one weekend a month exploring Wyoming's national forests and parks. Despite their long-term commitment, they have chosen not to get married, citing a desire for simplicity and flexibility in their lives.\n\nAs a non-veteran and US-born citizen, J.D.'s perspective on politics is shaped by his experiences as a working-class American. He is concerned about the economic implications of climate change and supports policies that promote renewable energy development and job creation in the sector. However, he is also wary of government overreach and believes in individual freedom and limited government intervention in personal lives.\n\nJ.D. and Emily rent their apartment for $1,200 per month, which is relatively affordable in Cheyenne's housing market. They have a joint savings account and are working towards buying a house in the next few years, but for now, they prioritize travel and outdoor adventures over accumulating wealth.\n\nIn his free time, J.D. enjoys playing guitar, reading science fiction novels, and volunteering at a local environmental organization that advocates for sustainable land use practices in Wyoming. He is fluent in English and has a strong appreciation for the cultural diversity that exists in the Mountain West, despite the region's relatively low levels of ethnic diversity."
