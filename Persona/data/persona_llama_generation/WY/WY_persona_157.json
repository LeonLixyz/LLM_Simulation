  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Morales, a 22-year-old, divorced, US-born Hispanic female of Puerto Rican descent. She is the primary householder of her single-person household in Cheyenne, Wyoming, specifically residing in the downtown area near the Cheyenne Depot Plaza. Alex holds a master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2022. Her proficiency in English is excellent, as it is her primary language.\n\nAlex works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm, earning an annual salary of $55,000. Her job involves assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of construction projects in the region. She has been in this role for about a year and is keen on advancing in her career, possibly specializing in sustainable energy solutions.\n\nAlthough Alex is divorced, her marriage was relatively short-lived, lasting about a year before ending in a mutual, amicable separation. She does not have any children. As a result, her household expenses are relatively low, with her primary costs being rent for her one-bedroom apartment ($1,200/month) and her student loan repayments ($500/month).\n\nAlex is a US citizen by birth, born in New Mexico but raised in Wyoming after her family moved when she was a child. Her parents, though divorced, are both involved in her life. Her mother is a teacher, and her father works in the oil industry. This diverse family background has influenced Alex's views on environmental issues and economic development.\n\nGiven her educational background and career focus, Alex is deeply concerned about the balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability. She supports policies promoting renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions, and preserving Wyoming's natural beauty. Her economic priorities include affordable education, job security, and access to quality healthcare. Alex's experiences as a young, divorced woman in a relatively conservative state have also made her an advocate for women's rights and social equality."
