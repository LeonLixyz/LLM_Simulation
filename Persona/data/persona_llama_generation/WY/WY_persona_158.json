  "PERSONA": "Juan Hernandez, a 48-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, resides in Casper, Wyoming, with his spouse. Born in the United States, specifically in Wyoming, Juan is a U.S. citizen who speaks English fluently and has no proficiency in any other language. He is a high school graduate, having completed his diploma at Natrona County High School in Casper. \n\nJuan works as an oil rig electrician, a job he has held for over a decade. His annual income is around $62,000, which is slightly above the state average. He and his spouse, Maria, have two children: Emily, 14, and David, 10. Both children attend public school in their neighborhood. \n\nAs the spouse of the household, Juan's wife, Maria, is the primary breadwinner, working as a nurse practitioner at the local hospital. Her income is around $80,000 annually. The couple owns a single-family home in the north side of Casper, which they purchased for $280,000 five years ago. They have a mortgage with a monthly payment of $1,800.\n\nJuan's economic concerns revolve around the volatility of the oil industry, which affects his job security, and the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly the increasing property taxes and healthcare costs. He is also worried about the quality of the local public schools and the lack of extracurricular activities for his children. Juan's political views are influenced by his economic situation, and he tends to support policies that promote job security, affordable healthcare, and quality education."
