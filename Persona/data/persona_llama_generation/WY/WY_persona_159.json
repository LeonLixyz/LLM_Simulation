  "PERSONA": "68-year-old male, named Kael Little Deer, who resides in a modest, single-story home in the outskirts of Casper, Wyoming. As a member of the Northern Arapaho Nation, Kael is deeply rooted in his American Indian heritage and actively participates in local cultural events. \n\nKael holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 1979. After graduating, he worked as a wildlife conservation specialist for the Wyoming Department of Game and Fish for nearly three decades before retiring in 2010. His job allowed him to travel extensively across the state, fostering a deep appreciation for Wyoming's natural beauty and a strong commitment to environmental stewardship.\n\nAs the primary householder, Kael lives alone in his home, which he owns outright after paying off the mortgage in 2005. His annual retirement income is approximately $43,000, consisting of his pension and Social Security benefits. He supplements this income with occasional consulting work for local environmental organizations, which earns him an additional $5,000 to $7,000 per year.\n\nKael has never been married and does not have children. However, he is close to his nieces and nephews, who live on the Wind River Reservation, and often attends family gatherings and cultural events there. He is fluent in English and has a good understanding of the Arapaho language, which he learned from his grandparents.\n\nKael's economic concerns center around preserving Wyoming's natural resources and addressing the impacts of climate change. He is also deeply invested in promoting the well-being of his community, particularly the younger generation, and often advocates for policies supporting education and job training programs. As a homeowner and retiree, Kael is sensitive to changes in property taxes and healthcare costs, which he believes should be more accessible and affordable for seniors.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Kael is accustomed to the state's conservative leanings but tends to vote independently, prioritizing issues that align with his values on environmental conservation, social justice, and community development. Despite his retirement, Kael remains active in his community, volunteering for local conservation initiatives and participating in town hall meetings to ensure his voice is heard on matters affecting his state and the nation."
