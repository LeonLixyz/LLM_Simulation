  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 29-year-old male of White non-Hispanic ethnicity, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. He resides in the capital city, Cheyenne, in a middle-class neighborhood with his parents due to financial constraints, despite being married. Ryan's wife, Sofia, is 27 years old, and they have been married for three years. They met in college, where Ryan pursued a degree in Architectural Technology but had to drop out in his junior year due to financial difficulties.\n\nRyan works as a Draftsman in a local architecture firm, earning an annual salary of $22,500. His job involves creating detailed drawings and blueprints for various construction projects, which he enjoys as it allows him to express his creativity. Despite his passion for architecture, Ryan feels underpaid and overworked, often putting in extra hours without overtime pay.\n\nRyan's family dynamic is close-knit. His father, a retired mechanic, and his mother, a part-time librarian, have always been supportive of his career goals. However, living with his parents at his age can be challenging, especially since he and his wife are trying to start a family of their own. They hope to move into their own apartment soon, but the high rent prices in Cheyenne are a significant barrier.\n\nRyan speaks fluent English, having grown up in the United States, but his family has a strong cultural heritage, with his grandparents immigrating from Ireland. He still celebrates traditional Irish holidays and values the importance of family.\n\nRyan's primary economic concerns are saving for a down payment on a house, paying off his student loans, and securing better health insurance for his growing family. He and his wife rely on private health insurance through his employer, but the premiums are high, and the coverage is limited. Ryan feels that the current healthcare system is inadequate and hopes for reforms that would make quality healthcare more accessible and affordable.\n\nRyan's political views are shaped by his experiences as a young adult struggling to make ends meet. He supports policies that promote affordable housing, student loan forgiveness, and improved access to healthcare. He is also concerned about the environmental impact of large-scale construction projects and believes that sustainable architecture should be a priority."
