  "PERSONA": "Deborah \"Debbie\" Wilson, a 62-year-old white female, living in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming. She is a divorced woman, who has been married once for nearly 20 years before her divorce 10 years ago. Debbie shares a household with her partner, 65-year-old John, a retired mechanic, whom she has been in a committed relationship with for the past 5 years. They reside in a cozy, two-bedroom house on the outskirts of Cody, which they rent for $800 per month.\n\nDebbie works part-time as an administrative assistant at a local healthcare clinic, earning $28,000 per year. She holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming, which she obtained in 1985. Her job is stable, but the pay is modest, and she often has to juggle her finances to make ends meet. Debbie's economic concerns are centered around maintaining her current standard of living, affording healthcare, and ensuring a comfortable retirement.\n\nDebbie was born and raised in Wyoming and has lived in the state her entire life. Her roots in the community run deep, and she values the close-knit nature of small-town life. She is an avid outdoorswoman and enjoys hiking, fishing, and horseback riding in her free time. Debbie's strong connection to her community and the natural environment shapes her views on local economic development, conservation, and environmental policies.\n\nDebbie's family structure is complex; she has two adult children from her previous marriage, both of whom live out of state. Her son, 35, is a software engineer in California, and her daughter, 32, is a teacher in Colorado. Debbie's relationship with her children is close, but she wishes they could visit more often. She also has three grandchildren, who she spoils rotten whenever they come to visit.\n\nAs a divorced woman in a committed relationship, Debbie's views on social issues are moderate to liberal. She values individual freedom, equality, and access to affordable healthcare. Her economic concerns and experiences have led her to support policies that promote job creation, affordable housing, and social security. Debbie is an active voter and participates in local town hall meetings, where she voices her opinions on issues affecting her community."
