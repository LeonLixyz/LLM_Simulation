  "PERSONA": "Alex Thompson, a 29-year-old white male, resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital. Born in Denver, Colorado, Alex moved to Wyoming with his family at the age of 10, when his father, a civil engineer, took a job at the Wyoming Department of Transportation. \n\nAlex is married to his high school sweetheart, Emily, whom he met in his junior year. The couple married two years ago in a small ceremony at a local park. Despite being married, Alex still lives with his parents due to financial constraints and the high cost of housing in Cheyenne. His parents, both in their mid-50s, are supportive of the arrangement, as it allows Alex to save money for a future home.\n\nAlex graduated from Cheyenne's East High School and did not pursue higher education due to financial reasons. He works as a sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, earning approximately $35,000 annually. His job allows him to interact with customers and be involved in the outdoor activities he loves, such as hiking and camping.\n\nAlex's economic concerns center around saving for a home, paying off his student loans from a short stint at a community college, and building a stable financial future for himself and his wife. He is keenly aware of the housing market in Cheyenne and the need for affordable options, which often influences his views on local politics and economic policies.\n\nIn his free time, Alex enjoys exploring Wyoming's natural landscapes and volunteering at local conservation efforts. His love for the outdoors and desire to preserve Wyoming's natural beauty often shapes his opinions on environmental policies and the role of government in conservation.\n\nAs a non-voter in local elections, Alex is now considering becoming more involved in the political process, driven by his concerns about affordable housing and the need for more job opportunities in Cheyenne."
