  "PERSONA": "Meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old widow who lives with her parents in a rural area of Wyoming. As a member of the White and American Indian and Alaska Native community, Alex's mixed heritage has instilled in her a strong appreciation for cultural diversity and a deep connection to the natural world.\n\nAssuming the null value for \"HOUSEHOLD_TYPE\" indicates a non-traditional household arrangement, Alex resides in her childhood home, a cozy ranch-style house on the outskirts of Cody, Wyoming, where she has returned to care for her aging parents after her husband's passing. This living arrangement allows her to support her family while also pursuing her career goals.\n\nAlex holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which has equipped her with a solid understanding of ecological principles and policy-making processes. She works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm, specializing in sustainability projects and wildlife conservation. Her annual income is around $62,000, which is slightly above the median household income in Wyoming.\n\nAs a widow, Alex's primary economic concerns revolve around securing a stable financial future for herself and her family. She is diligent about saving for her parents' potential long-term care needs and her own retirement. Her late husband's life insurance policy has helped alleviate some financial burdens, but she remains cautious about her spending habits.\n\nLiving in rural Wyoming, Alex is deeply invested in local issues, such as land use, water management, and wildlife conservation. Her professional experience and personal interests make her a strong advocate for environmentally conscious policies and sustainable development in her community.\n\nAlex's educational background and career trajectory have not only shaped her economic views but also influenced her political priorities. She is likely to support policies that promote environmental protection, education, and social welfare programs, particularly those benefiting rural communities and Native American populations.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking, birdwatching, and volunteering for local conservation initiatives. Her connection to the land and her community informs her economic and political perspectives, making her a thoughtful and engaged citizen in her rural Wyoming town."
