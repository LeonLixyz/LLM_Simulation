She holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Colorado Boulder, which she completed in 2007.\n\nEmily works as an Environmental Consultant for a private firm in Casper, specializing in sustainability and conservation projects.

Emily's husband, Michael, is a high school teacher, and his income is around $48,000 per year.\n\nThe couple owns a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood in Casper, which they purchased in 2015 for $280,000. They have a mortgage with a monthly payment of $1,400. Emily's education and career trajectory have allowed her to maintain a stable financial situation, but she is concerned about the impact of economic fluctuations on their household income and the local community.\n\nEmily's economic priorities include affordable healthcare, education, and environmental conservation. As a homeowner and a professional in the environmental sector, she is particularly interested in policies that promote sustainable development and support local businesses.
