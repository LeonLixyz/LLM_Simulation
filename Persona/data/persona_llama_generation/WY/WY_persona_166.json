  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 28-year-old White male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He resides with his parents in a suburban neighborhood. Born in New Mexico, Juan's family moved to Wyoming when he was a teenager, which explains his \"Different state\" birth detail. As a non-veteran, Juan has focused on his education and career.\n\nJuan's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied automotive repair. Although he did not obtain a degree, this education has been beneficial in his current role as a mechanic at a local car dealership. He earns $38,000 per year, which is modest but sufficient for his lifestyle.\n\nAs a child living with his parents, Juan's housing situation is stable, with no immediate concerns about rent or mortgage. His parents, both retired, own the house, which they purchased 15 years ago. The household is comfortable, with Juan contributing to the family income and helping with expenses.\n\nJuan's proficiency in English is limited, and he primarily speaks Spanish at home with his parents. However, he has learned enough English to effectively communicate with his coworkers and customers at the dealership.\n\nJuan's economic concerns revolve around career advancement and financial stability. He hopes to become a master mechanic or even open his own repair shop one day. His immediate priorities include building an emergency fund, paying off personal debt, and saving for a down payment on a house.\n\nJuan's marital status is \"Never married,\" and he is currently not in a serious relationship. His social life is centered around his family and a close-knit group of friends from the local Latino community.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Juan is concerned about the state's economic fluctuations, particularly in the energy sector, which affects his friends and acquaintances who work in the industry. He is also interested in policies that support small businesses and promote economic growth in his community."
