  "PERSONA": "Name: Ethan Thompson \nAge: 29 years old \nSex: Male \nRace: White \nEthnicity: Non-Hispanic (assumed due to the high proportion of Non-Hispanic Whites in Wyoming) \n\nEthan resides in Cheyenne, the state capital of Wyoming, with his wife in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom rented apartment in a suburban neighborhood. As the spouse of the household, Ethan's wife is the primary breadwinner, working as a software engineer. Ethan himself holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he completed two years ago. Currently, he works as an Environmental Consultant at a local firm, earning a gross income of $55,000 per year.\n\nBorn in Bozeman, Montana, Ethan moved to Wyoming for his graduate studies and decided to stay after falling in love with the state's natural beauty and outdoor recreation opportunities. He is a fluent English speaker and has never served in the military. As a couple, Ethan and his wife prioritize saving for a down payment on a house, navigating the challenges of the local housing market, and planning for a family in the near future.\n\nEthan's economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, the need for more job opportunities in his field that offer better pay, and access to affordable healthcare. Given his background in environmental science, he is also passionate about conservation efforts and sustainable development in Wyoming. Politically, Ethan leans toward moderate policies that balance economic growth with environmental protection and social welfare."
