  "PERSONA": "Alexander \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old White male, is the primary householder of a single-person household in a modest, rented apartment in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He has been married to his high school sweetheart, Emily, for two years, but they currently live separately due to work commitments. Alex holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Laramie County Community College, which he completed in 2020. As a non-veteran, Alex does not have any military experience. Born and raised in Wyoming, Alex speaks English fluently and has never spoken any other language at home.\n\nAlex works as a full-time Automotive Technician at a local car dealership in Cheyenne, earning an annual salary of $45,000. He has been in this role for about a year and a half and enjoys the hands-on nature of his job. Alex's job security and decent income allow him to afford his rent ($800 per month) and save up for a down payment on a house. He is currently taking online courses to upgrade his skills and become a Master Technician, which would increase his earning potential.\n\nAlex's primary economic concerns are saving for a down payment on a house and paying off his student loan debt, which totals around $10,000. He is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Cheyenne and the impact of inflation on his savings. As a young married couple, Alex and Emily hope to start a family soon, which would require significant adjustments to their budget and long-term financial planning. Alex is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to affordable housing, education, and economic development in Wyoming."
