  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson, a 79-year-old white female, has lived in Cheyenne, Wyoming, for the past 40 years. She is the primary householder of a single-family home she owns in a quiet suburban neighborhood. Agnes never married and has two adult children, aged 51 and 48, both of whom have moved out but remain close to her.\n\nAgnes was born in Illinois and moved to Wyoming in her late 30s. She is a high school graduate, having completed her education in her hometown before relocating. Her English proficiency is excellent, as it is her native language.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Agnes's career spanned 35 years as a librarian at the local public library. She worked her way up from an assistant librarian to a senior librarian position before retiring at 65. Her annual retirement income is approximately $55,000, which includes a modest pension and social security benefits.\n\nAgnes's household income is supplemented by renting out a small apartment above her garage to a local college student, providing an additional $8,000 annually. She has managed her finances carefully, ensuring she has some savings for emergencies and long-term care, given her advanced age.\n\nAgnes's economic concerns center around maintaining her independence and ensuring she can afford potential future healthcare costs. Her children, though supportive, have their own families and financial responsibilities, and she does not wish to be a burden. She is particularly keen on political policies that support affordable healthcare, especially for seniors, and those that encourage intergenerational housing solutions.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Agnes values the state's wide open spaces and the outdoor lifestyle it offers. However, she is also aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy sector and is concerned about the impact of economic downturns on her retirement security. Thus, she supports policies that diversify the state's economy and provide a safety net for seniors during economic uncertainties.\n\nAgnes's specific neighborhood is a mix of retirees and young families, which she finds appealing. It's within walking distance to local shops and parks, allowing her to maintain an active lifestyle. Despite her age, Agnes remains engaged with her community, volunteering at the local library's children's reading program and participating in neighborhood watch initiatives."
