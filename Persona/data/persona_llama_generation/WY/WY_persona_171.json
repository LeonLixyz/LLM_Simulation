  "PERSONA": "John Smith is a 38-year-old white male who has experienced a significant downturn in his life, currently classified as homeless in Casper, Wyoming. Born in Colorado, John grew up in a middle-class family and was raised with strong American values. He never married and has no dependents. \n\nJohn holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 2008. After graduating, he worked for several years as a field technician for a private environmental consulting firm in Cheyenne, Wyoming. However, due to company restructuring and the decline of the oil and gas industry in the region, John lost his job in 2019 and struggled to find stable employment.\n\nAssuming John's ethnicity is non-Hispanic, given the absence of this information, he identifies as a white non-Hispanic male.\n\nBefore becoming homeless, John lived in a rented one-bedroom apartment in downtown Casper. Due to his job loss, he was unable to afford the rent, and his savings eventually depleted. Currently, he resides in a local homeless shelter and is actively seeking employment and permanent housing.\n\nJohn is fluent in English, having spoken it as his primary language since birth. As a US citizen born in a different state, he maintains strong ties to his community and hopes to rebuild his life in Wyoming. His economic concerns revolve around finding stable employment, securing affordable housing, and rebuilding his savings.\n\nJohn's educational background and work experience in environmental science have instilled in him a strong appreciation for conservation and sustainability. However, his current situation has shifted his priorities toward economic stability and security. He is likely to support policies that address homelessness, job creation, and affordable housing, while also considering environmental protection measures that promote sustainable economic growth."
