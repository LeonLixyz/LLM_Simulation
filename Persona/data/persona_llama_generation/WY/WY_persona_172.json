  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male living in Casper, Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Sarah, who works as an elementary school teacher. Ethan is a high school graduate and did not pursue higher education due to family financial constraints and a desire to enter the workforce early. \n\nEthan works as a heavy equipment mechanic at a local construction company, earning $62,000 per year. His job is physically demanding but provides a stable income and benefits, which are essential for supporting his family. Ethan and Sarah have two children, Emily (8) and Jackson (5), who attend the local public school system. \n\nThe family resides in a modest, three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Casper. They purchased the house for $240,000 five years ago, and their current mortgage is $1,800 per month. Ethan and his family enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking and fishing, which Wyoming's natural beauty provides ample opportunities for.\n\nEthan's economic concerns include saving for his children's education and ensuring the family's financial stability in the face of economic uncertainty. He is worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential for job insecurity in the construction industry. Ethan is also concerned about the impact of climate change on Wyoming's economy, particularly the decline of the coal industry, which has historically been a significant employer in the state.\n\nEthan's wife, Sarah, is the primary decision-maker when it comes to household finances, but Ethan is involved in long-term financial planning, such as saving for retirement and the children's education. Ethan's lack of a college education sometimes makes him feel insecure about his career prospects, but his experience and skills as a mechanic have provided him with a stable income and a sense of pride in his work.\n\nAssumptions made based on the metadata include: Ethan's household type is assumed to be a family household with a married couple and their own children, given his marital status and household relationship. His ethnicity is assumed to be non-Hispanic, given the lack of information to the contrary and the prevalence of non-Hispanic whites in Wyoming."
