  "PERSONA": "Name: Karen Thompson\n\nAge: 49 years\n\nSex: Female\n\nRace: White\n\nEthnicity: Assuming non-Hispanic based on the absence of specified ethnicity and the high prevalence of non-Hispanic Whites in Wyoming, Karen is a non-Hispanic White.\n\nOccupation: Karen works as a Clinical Psychologist, utilizing her Doctoral degree in Psychology (Ph.D.) from the University of Wyoming. She has been in this profession for over a decade, working with a private practice in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nIncome: Karen's annual income is $105,000, placing her in a comfortable middle-class position, though with some financial strain due to being a single parent.\n\nHousehold Type: Karen lives with her two children, ages 10 and 12, in a single-family home she owns in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne. The house, valued at $320,000, is a significant asset but also a source of financial responsibility, especially since her divorce. Her ex-husband contributes to the children's expenses, but Karen is the primary provider.\n\nEducation: Karen holds a Doctorate in Psychology from the University of Wyoming and a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from the same institution. Her educational background is a significant factor in her career success and economic stability.\n\nLocation: Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital, provides Karen with a stable job market and a relatively low cost of living compared to other parts of the country. However, the state's economy, heavily reliant on the energy industry, can be unpredictable, which might influence her economic concerns.\n\nFamily Structure and Responsibilities: As a single mother, Karen's primary focus is on providing for her children. Her divorce has not only affected her financial situation but also means she has to balance work and parenting responsibilities alone. This has made her particularly concerned about healthcare access, education quality, and economic stability.\n\nEconomic Concerns/Priorities: Karen's main economic concerns include maintaining her current standard of living, ensuring her children's future through education and healthcare, and navigating the challenges of being a single-income household in a state with an economy that can be volatile. Her priorities include access to quality, affordable healthcare, education, and policies that support single-parent households and professionals in her field.\n\nPolitical Views: While specific political affiliations are not detailed in the metadata, based on her background and concerns, Karen might lean towards policies and politicians who support healthcare access, education funding, and economic stability, particularly for single-parent households and professionals in the healthcare sector."
