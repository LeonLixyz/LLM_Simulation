  "PERSONA": "John Michael Thompson, a 62-year-old male, born in the United States but in a state other than Wyoming. He identifies as White and has some other racial ancestry. John has a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, which he earned from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is a non-veteran and has never served in the military.\n\nJohn lives in a household in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital, where he has resided for over a decade. He is currently separated from his spouse, Sarah, with whom he has two adult children, Emily (28) and Michael (25), both of whom have moved out of the family home. John's marital status is separated, but he has not yet divorced, as the process is ongoing.\n\nJohn is fluent in English, having spoken it as his primary language since birth, and has no reported proficiency issues. He has been the spouse of the household, meaning his wife was the primary breadwinner until their separation. John's current economic situation is precarious, with his annual income being around $43,000, primarily from part-time work as a sales representative for an outdoor gear store. He supplements this income by working as a part-time instructor at a local community college, teaching courses on business management.\n\nJohn's educational background has played a significant role in his career trajectory. Initially, he worked in management positions in various retail establishments but found it challenging to advance without an advanced degree. He decided to pursue a career change, leveraging his degree to teach and work part-time in retail, which offers more flexibility as he navigates his personal life changes.\n\nJohn and his wife own their home, a modest two-bedroom house in a mixed neighborhood in Cheyenne, with a mortgage of around $1,200 per month. However, with the separation, there are discussions about how to divide assets, including the house. John's economic concerns are centered around maintaining his standard of living, ensuring he can continue to afford his part of the mortgage payments, and securing a more stable financial future as he approaches retirement age.\n\nGiven his age, John is also concerned about healthcare costs and the affordability of insurance. He has been covered under his wife's employer-provided plan but will need to find alternative coverage soon. These economic pressures, along with the uncertainty of his marital situation, significantly influence his economic and political views, making him keenly interested in policies related to healthcare, employment opportunities for older workers, and financial security for retirees."
