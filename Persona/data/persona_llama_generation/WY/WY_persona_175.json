She is a veteran who served in the United States Army for six years as a medical assistant. Emily is a high school graduate, having attended Cheyenne East High School, and although she does not have a college degree, her experience in the military has provided her with valuable skills in medical administration.\n\nEmily's husband, John, is the primary breadwinner in the family, working as a mechanical engineer at a local manufacturing plant. Emily currently works part-time as a medical receptionist at a small clinic in downtown Cheyenne, earning approximately $35,000 per year. The couple's combined annual income is around $85,000.\n\nEmily and John own a single-family home in the north part of Cheyenne, which they purchased in 2005 for $220,000. They have two children, aged 16 and 18, who attend local public schools. The 16-year-old is a high school sophomore, while the 18-year-old is preparing to attend the University of Wyoming in the fall.\n\nGiven her experience as a veteran and a medical professional, Emily is particularly concerned about healthcare policy and veterans' benefits. She is also invested in education, as her children are nearing college age and she wants to ensure they have access to affordable higher education options.\n\nEmily's economic priorities include job security, access to affordable healthcare, and ensuring her children's educational and financial futures. Her experience as a veteran and a working mother in a relatively small city like Cheyenne gives her a unique perspective on the challenges faced by families in rural areas and the importance of local economic development."
