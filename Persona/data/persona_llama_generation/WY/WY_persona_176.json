  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 29-year-old white male living with his parents in Casper, Wyoming. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Emily, whom he met in his junior year. Ethan and Emily got married three years ago, shortly after Ethan's 26th birthday. They do not have any children yet, but they are planning to start a family in the next few years.\n\nEthan is a high school graduate, having completed his education at Natrona County High School in Casper. After high school, he did not pursue higher education, instead opting to enter the workforce directly. Ethan currently works as a heavy equipment operator in the construction sector, earning an annual salary of $52,000. His job is physically demanding, but it provides a stable income and benefits, which is crucial for his future family plans.\n\nEthan's parents, John and Sarah, own a modest single-family home in a suburban neighborhood in Casper, where Ethan and Emily live in a converted basement apartment. The arrangement allows Ethan and Emily to save on rent and focus on building their own life together. Ethan's parents are supportive of their living situation, and they often share meals and household responsibilities.\n\nEthan's primary economic concerns revolve around saving for a down payment on a house and planning for the added expenses of starting a family. He is also interested in advancing his career, possibly by obtaining certifications or specialized training in his field, to increase his earning potential. As a resident of Wyoming, Ethan is aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and is concerned about the impact of economic downturns on his job security.\n\nEthan's political views are shaped by his experiences as a working-class individual and his concerns about economic stability. He is likely to support policies that promote job creation, affordable housing, and access to education and training programs that can help him advance in his career."
