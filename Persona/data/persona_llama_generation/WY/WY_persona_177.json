  "PERSONA": "Meet 57-year-old Sandra Johnson, a white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides with her parents in a single-family home in a quiet suburban neighborhood, where she has been since moving back to care for her aging parents. Sandra is married to her husband, Tom, but they currently live separately due to his work in the oil fields, which requires him to spend several weeks at a time in North Dakota.\n\nSandra's educational background includes a high school diploma from her hometown in Ohio, where she was born and raised. After high school, she worked in retail and later in administrative roles but never pursued higher education due to family responsibilities and personal priorities. She speaks English fluently, having been born and raised in the United States.\n\nSandra's current occupation is as a part-time administrative assistant at a local veterinary clinic, earning approximately $35,000 per year. This job offers her the flexibility to care for her parents and manage the household. Her parents, both in their early eighties, require increasing care, especially her mother, who suffers from dementia. Sandra's primary economic concerns revolve around healthcare costs for her parents and ensuring their well-being without depleting their life savings.\n\nSandra's economic situation is further complicated by her husband's income, which, while substantial, is irregular due to the nature of his work. Tom works as a rig manager, earning around $80,000 annually, but his income varies greatly from month to month. This unpredictability makes budgeting challenging for Sandra, who manages the household finances. They own their home outright, having paid off the mortgage several years ago, but they are cautious with their spending due to the uncertainty of Tom's income and the rising costs of healthcare for Sandra's parents.\n\nGiven her situation, Sandra's political views tend to lean towards policies that support family care, affordable healthcare, and economic stability for middle-class families. She is particularly interested in local policies that could ease the burden of caregiving and support families dealing with dementia and other long-term care needs. Despite her busy schedule, Sandra finds time to participate in local community events and is an active member of a caregiver support group in Cheyenne."
