  "PERSONA": "Reginald \"Reg\" Thompson, a 68-year-old divorced male, born in Montana but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He lives alone in a single-family home he owns in a suburban neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. As a veteran of the US Army, Reg spent four years serving his country before pursuing higher education.\n\nReg holds a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 1985. This educational background has served him well in his career as a software engineer at a local tech firm, where he has worked for over two decades. His job involves designing and developing software solutions for various industries, including energy and finance. Reg's annual income is $62,000, which is supplemented by a modest pension from his military service.\n\nAs a homeowner, Reg is proud of his property, which he has lived in for over 20 years. He has a small mortgage balance and spends about 15% of his income on housing costs, including property taxes and insurance. Reg has private health insurance through his employer, which covers most of his medical expenses.\n\nReg's divorce occurred about 10 years ago, and he has no children from that marriage. He remains on good terms with his ex-wife, who lives in another state. Reg's social life is relatively quiet, with most of his free time spent reading, watching documentaries, or taking long walks in the nearby mountains.\n\nAs a veteran and a long-time resident of Wyoming, Reg is deeply concerned about issues affecting his community, such as access to quality healthcare, affordable housing, and the impact of economic development on the state's natural resources. He is also interested in policies that support veterans' welfare and education. Reg's economic priorities include maintaining a stable income, managing his retirement savings, and ensuring that his property values remain stable."
