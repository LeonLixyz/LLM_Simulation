  "PERSONA": "John Thompson is a 62-year-old white male living in Wyoming. As a non-veteran, he has never served in the military. Born in Ohio, he moved to Wyoming about 20 years ago for work. John is married but has never been formally married, having entered into a domestic partnership with his spouse. He resides with his partner in a household in the suburban town of Lander, Wyoming, where they rent a two-bedroom house. John's primary language is English, which he speaks fluently.\n\nJohn holds an associate's degree in business administration, which he obtained after two years of community college. He works as an office manager for a local construction company, earning an annual salary of $55,000. His spouse, who works as a part-time librarian, supplements their household income with an additional $20,000 per year.\n\nJohn and his partner do not have any children together, but his spouse has two adult children from a previous relationship. They have two grandchildren, whom they occasionally care for during the summer. This arrangement allows them to maintain a relatively stable financial situation, with a combined household income of $75,000.\n\nTheir economic concerns primarily revolve around saving for retirement and maintaining health insurance coverage, given the rising costs of living in Wyoming. John is particularly concerned about access to quality healthcare in rural areas, which he believes is often underfunded. He also worries about the impact of inflation on their retirement savings and the potential for reduced social security benefits.\n\nIn his free time, John enjoys outdoor activities, such as hiking and fishing, which Wyoming's natural landscape readily provides. He actively participates in local community events, including town hall meetings, to stay informed about issues affecting his community and express his opinions on policy decisions."
