  "PERSONA": "George Thompson, a 68-year-old White male, is the primary householder of a married-couple household with kids. Born in California, George has lived in various parts of the United States but currently resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Susan, and they have two adult children, Emily and Michael, who are both in their mid-30s. Emily lives with her family in the same neighborhood, while Michael resides in Denver, Colorado.\n\nGeorge's education background includes completing two years of community college, where he studied business administration. However, he did not pursue a degree, opting instead to enter the workforce early to support his family. His career spans over four decades, primarily in the retail sector, with the last 15 years spent as a store manager for a local hardware store in Cheyenne. He earns an annual income of $55,000, supplemented by a modest retirement plan.\n\nGeorge and his family own a two-story, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they purchased in 2005 for $220,000. The property has appreciated in value over the years and is now worth around $320,000. George is proud of his DIY skills, often taking on home improvement projects in his free time.\n\nAs a non-veteran, George does not have direct military experience, but his brother served in the Army, and he has always been supportive of veterans' causes. George speaks English fluently and has never had any issues with language proficiency.\n\nGeorge's economic concerns include saving for retirement, managing healthcare costs, and ensuring his children's financial stability. As a resident of Wyoming, he is keenly aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and its implications for the local job market. George's primary economic priority is maintaining a stable income to support his family's needs while navigating the challenges of an aging population in a state with limited social services.\n\nIn his free time, George enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. He is also an avid reader, often devouring books on American history and politics. George's family has always been his top priority, and he strives to create a comfortable and secure life for his loved ones."
