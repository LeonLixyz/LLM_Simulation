  "PERSONA": "Meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 49-year-old White female living in Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder of a single-person household, Alex has been divorced for about five years, following a 10-year marriage that ended due to irreconcilable differences. She has no children from the marriage, which has given her the freedom to focus on her career and personal interests.\n\nAlex was born and raised in Wyoming, specifically in the small town of Lander, where she spent her childhood and teenage years. She later moved to Casper for college, attending Casper College for two years to study business administration before dropping out due to financial constraints. Despite not having a degree, Alex has been able to secure stable employment in the retail sector, working as an assistant store manager at a local outdoor gear store, earning an annual income of $43,000.\n\nAs a homeowner, Alex purchased a modest, two-bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood in Casper about seven years ago, taking advantage of low interest rates and a relatively affordable housing market. Her monthly mortgage payment is $850, which, combined with her car loan and other living expenses, accounts for about 60% of her take-home income.\n\nAlex's economic concerns are centered around maintaining her financial stability and securing her future. She has been diligently paying off her mortgage and car loan while trying to build an emergency fund. She is also concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of economic downturns on her job security. Politically, Alex tends to lean towards moderate conservatism, prioritizing fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention in the economy. However, she also values social programs that support education and healthcare, reflecting her personal experiences and concerns.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing, which are readily available in Wyoming's vast natural landscapes. She also volunteers at a local animal shelter, reflecting her compassion for animals and her desire to contribute to her community."
