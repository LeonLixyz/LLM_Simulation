She holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she attended after moving from her birth state of Colorado. Emily is a non-veteran and has always spoken English as her primary language, doing so fluently.\n\nEmily works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm, earning an annual income of $62,000. Her job involves assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of construction projects in Wyoming's growing energy sector. This role utilizes her educational background and allows her to contribute to the state's economic development while addressing her concerns about environmental sustainability.\n\nEmily is married to a high school history teacher, and they have two children, ages 7 and 9, who attend the local public school system. The family owns a single-family home valued at $280,000 in a neighborhood with good schools and community amenities. They have a mortgage of $180,000 with a monthly payment of $900, which is manageable given their combined household income of $110,000.\n\nEmily's educational background has significantly influenced her career trajectory, allowing her to secure a job that aligns with her interests and skills. However, she sometimes worries about job security due to fluctuations in the energy sector and the potential for environmental policy changes. Her family responsibilities, including saving for her children's future education and ensuring they have access to quality healthcare, are her top economic concerns.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Emily is keenly aware of the state's reliance on the energy industry and the economic implications of shifts towards renewable energy sources. She supports policies that promote sustainable development and environmental protection while also considering the economic impact on local communities. Her views on economic and political issues are shaped by her role as a mother, her career in environmental science, and her experiences as a resident of Wyoming."
