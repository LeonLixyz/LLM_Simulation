  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Maya Ramos, a White and Hispanic woman living in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. Maya is married to her high school sweetheart, Alex, and they have a 7-year-old son named Ethan. Due to financial constraints, Maya and her family live with her parents, John and Emily, in a cozy three-bedroom house on the outskirts of town. This living arrangement allows Maya to save on rent and focus on paying off her student loans from a local community college, where she studied early childhood education after graduating from high school.\n\nMaya works part-time as a teaching assistant at a local elementary school, earning $25,000 per year. Her husband, Alex, works full-time as a mechanic at a local garage, earning $45,000 per year. Maya's income is supplemented by her parents, who contribute to household expenses and help with childcare. Maya's long-term goal is to become a certified teacher, but for now, she prioritizes caring for her son and supporting her family.\n\nMaya's family struggles to make ends meet, with a combined household income of around $70,000 per year. They have to be mindful of their expenses, often having to choose between paying bills on time or saving for the future. Maya's economic concerns include affording healthcare, saving for her son's education, and eventually moving into their own home. Despite these challenges, Maya values her family's well-being and is committed to creating a stable and loving environment for her son to grow.\n\nMaya's experiences as a working mother and her reliance on her parents' support have shaped her views on economic and social policies. She advocates for affordable childcare, increased funding for public education, and programs that support low-income families. Maya also prioritizes access to affordable healthcare and job training initiatives that can help her and her husband advance in their careers. Living in a small town in Wyoming, Maya is also concerned about the local economy and the impact of national policies on rural communities."
