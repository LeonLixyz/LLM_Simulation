  "PERSONA": "Meet Maria Elena Hernandez, a 38-year-old Hispanic female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is a widow and resides with her parents, which is a common arrangement in her close-knit community. Maria's parents own a modest two-story home in a mixed-income neighborhood near downtown Casper, where she has lived for the past five years after moving from New Mexico, her birth state.\n\nMaria has an associate's degree in business administration but did not complete her bachelor's degree due to family obligations. She works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local non-profit organization focused on providing resources to the Hispanic community in Wyoming, earning approximately $28,000 per year. Her job requires strong English skills, which she possesses, having spoken English well since childhood.\n\nAs a widow, Maria's economic situation is precarious. Her late husband was the primary breadwinner, and his passing left her with significant medical bills and a reduced income. She receives some financial assistance from her parents and is in the process of navigating government programs to support her family.\n\nMaria has two children, ages 10 and 12, who attend the local public school. Her children are her top priority, and she is concerned about their education and future economic prospects. As a single mother living with her parents, Maria is eager to regain financial stability and independence. She is anxious about the rising costs of living in Casper, particularly housing and healthcare, and hopes for policies that address these concerns.\n\nIn her free time, Maria volunteers at the local community center, where she helps other Hispanic families access resources and services. She is fluent in English and has a strong connection to her Hispanic heritage, which she passes on to her children through traditional cooking, music, and cultural events.\n\nMaria's economic concerns center around affordable housing, access to quality education, and job opportunities that can support her family's well-being. She is likely to support policies that promote economic growth, improve access to healthcare, and provide resources for single mothers and minority communities."
