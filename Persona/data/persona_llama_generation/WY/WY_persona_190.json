  "PERSONA": "Margaret \"Peggy\" Thompson, a 68-year-old White female, born in the state of Nebraska but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder in a married-couple household with her husband, John, and their youngest son, James, who is a high school senior. Peggy is a high school graduate, having attended and graduated from Lincoln High School in Nebraska before moving to Wyoming with her family over 20 years ago.\n\nPeggy has been married to John, a 70-year-old retired mechanic, for 43 years. Their eldest son, Michael, is a 40-year-old engineer who lives in Denver, Colorado, with his wife and two children. Peggy's household is considered a married-couple family with kids, as James still lives at home while attending high school.\n\nIn terms of language, Peggy speaks only English and does so fluently, having been born and raised in the United States. She has never served in the military and identifies as a non-veteran.\n\nPeggy's educational background as a high school graduate has influenced her career trajectory. She worked as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Cheyenne for over 15 years before retiring at the age of 62. Her husband, John, worked as a mechanic at a local garage and retired at 65. Their combined retirement income is approximately $55,000 per year, which they supplement with Social Security benefits.\n\nThe Thompsons own a single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood in Cheyenne, which they purchased in 1995 for $120,000. The current market value of their home is around $280,000. They have a mortgage of $80,000, which they pay off at a rate of $1,200 per month.\n\nPeggy's primary economic concerns include ensuring her youngest son completes his education and becomes financially independent, managing her household's retirement income to maintain their current standard of living, and addressing the rising costs of healthcare as she and her husband age. She is also concerned about the impact of inflation on their fixed income and the potential for changes in Social Security benefits.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Peggy is likely to be influenced by the state's strong conservative leanings and may prioritize issues such as lower taxes, limited government intervention in personal affairs, and the protection of individual freedoms. However, her experience as a retiree and a mother may also lead her to support policies that promote affordable healthcare, education, and social security."
