  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson, an 87-year-old male of White and Black or African American descent, has been the primary householder of his household in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming, for the past 40 years. He is married to his second wife, Margaret, whom he met through a veterans' organization. Harold is a veteran of the Vietnam War and served in the US Army for 4 years. After his military service, he pursued a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, graduating in 1967.\n\nHarold spent most of his career working as a manager at a local lumber mill in Cody, where he worked for 25 years before retiring at the age of 62. He has been receiving a pension from the mill and supplemental income from his investments, resulting in an annual household income of approximately $52,000. Harold is proud of his financial planning and considers himself fortunate to have a stable financial situation.\n\nHarold and Margaret own their home, a modest, single-story ranch-style house on a 2-acre property on the outskirts of Cody. They have no children together, but Harold has two grown children from his previous marriage, both of whom live in other parts of the country. Despite the distance, Harold remains close to his children and grandchildren, with whom he regularly communicates via phone and video calls.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of Wyoming, Harold has a strong affinity for the state's natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities. He is an avid hunter and fisherman and spends much of his free time exploring the surrounding wilderness areas. Harold's economic concerns center around the impact of climate change on the local environment and the potential effects on his property value and outdoor activities.\n\nHarold's experiences as a veteran and his career in the lumber industry have instilled in him a strong sense of patriotism and a appreciation for hard work. He is a staunch supporter of local businesses and is actively involved in his community through volunteer work at the local VFW post. Harold's political views tend to be conservative, with a focus on issues related to veterans' rights, environmental conservation, and small business development."
