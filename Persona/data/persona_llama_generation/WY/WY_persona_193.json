  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson is a 38-year-old white female, born and raised in Wyoming, specifically in the small town of Lander. She is a veteran of the US Army, where she served for six years as a logistics specialist. After her service, she moved back to Wyoming and currently resides in a shared house in Casper, the second-largest city in the state, with two non-related housemates. Alex has never been married and does not have any children.\n\nShe completed her GED after dropping out of high school in the 12th grade and has since taken a few community college courses to improve her job prospects. Alex is fluent in English and speaks it well, but her first language is Lithuanian, which she learned from her grandparents who immigrated to the US. She works as a warehouse manager at a local outdoor gear store, earning around $45,000 per year.\n\nAlex's economic concerns are centered around affordable healthcare, as she has lingering health issues from her time in the military. She also worries about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly housing costs, as she is currently renting a room in a shared house for $800 per month. She dreams of owning her own home one day but finds it challenging to save for a down payment on a modest house in the area.\n\nAs a veteran, Alex values patriotism and national security, but her experiences have also made her critical of unnecessary military interventions and advocate for better support systems for veterans. She is active in local veterans' groups and participates in community events to raise awareness about veterans' issues. Her background and current situation make her particularly interested in economic policies that support veterans, affordable housing initiatives, and accessible healthcare options."
