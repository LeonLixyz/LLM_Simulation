  "PERSONA": "Yumi Nakamura, a 49-year-old Japanese-American woman, born in the United States and residing in Casper, Wyoming. She lives with her older brother, who is the household's primary breadwinner, in a modest, rented two-bedroom apartment in a mixed-income neighborhood. Yumi's brother works as a mechanic, and their household income is approximately $55,000 per year.\n\nYumi is a veteran of the US Army, having served for six years as an administrative specialist. After her honorable discharge, she struggled to find stable employment due to her limited education, which consists of a high school equivalency diploma obtained through a GED program. She currently works part-time as a receptionist at a local insurance agency, earning around $28,000 annually.\n\nAs a never-married individual, Yumi's primary family responsibilities involve caring for her aging mother, who lives in a nearby assisted living facility. Yumi visits her mother regularly and manages her finances, which are supplemented by Yumi's brother and their household income.\n\nYumi's economic concerns revolve around affordable healthcare for her mother, the rising costs of living in Casper, and her own financial insecurity due to her part-time employment status. She is worried about the potential impact of policy changes on her brother's job as a mechanic, particularly those affecting the automotive industry.\n\nDespite these concerns, Yumi is proud of her US citizenship and values her role as a contributing member of her community. She actively participates in local veteran support groups and volunteers at a nearby food bank. Yumi's experience as a veteran and her struggles with employment have shaped her views on economic and social policies, leading her to prioritize issues like job security, affordable education, and veterans' benefits."
