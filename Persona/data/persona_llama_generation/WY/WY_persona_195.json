  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson, a 78-year-old White male, resides in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming. Born in Wyoming, Harold has lived in the state his entire life, fostering a strong sense of community and local pride. He is married to his wife, Margaret, aged 76, whom he met while attending the University of Wyoming, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Agriculture. They have been married for 53 years and have two grown children, both of whom have moved away from Wyoming for work.\n\nHarold worked as a ranch manager for over three decades, overseeing the operations of a large cattle ranch in the Big Horn Basin. He took pride in his work, managing the land and livestock with care, and was well-respected in the local community for his expertise. After retiring 10 years ago, Harold and Margaret moved to Cody to be closer to their grandchildren, who would visit during summer breaks.\n\nThe couple owns a modest two-bedroom home in Cody, which they purchased 15 years ago for $250,000. Their annual household income is approximately $55,000, consisting of Harold's retirement pension, Margaret's part-time income as a librarian, and some investments. Harold's monthly expenses include a $1,200 mortgage payment, $800 for groceries and utilities, and $500 for healthcare, including Medicare and supplemental insurance.\n\nHarold's primary economic concerns include the rising cost of healthcare, the impact of drought on local agriculture, and the increasing property taxes in Cody. He is also worried about the potential effects of climate change on Wyoming's rural economy and the preservation of open spaces. Harold and Margaret are avid supporters of local businesses and often participate in community events, such as the Cody Stampede Rodeo.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of Wyoming, Harold has a deep understanding of the state's politics and economy. He identifies as a moderate Republican, valuing individual freedom and limited government intervention. However, he also recognizes the importance of government support for rural areas, such as subsidies for farmers and ranchers, and infrastructure development. Harold's voting decisions are often influenced by his concerns for the local economy, healthcare, and the well-being of his community."
