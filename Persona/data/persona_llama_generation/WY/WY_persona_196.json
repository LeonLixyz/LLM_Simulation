  "PERSONA": "Alejandro Hernandez, a 38-year-old male of Latin American descent, born in Mexico, currently residing in the town of Jackson, Wyoming, with his partner. He speaks English well but considers Spanish his primary language. Alejandro is a high school graduate, having completed his education in Mexico before moving to the United States. Due to his immigration status as a non-U.S. citizen, he faces certain limitations in his career choices and access to social services.\n\nAlejandro works as a sous chef in a local restaurant in Jackson, earning approximately $38,000 per year. His income is supplemented by his partner, who works as a freelance writer. They share a modest, rented two-bedroom apartment in a mixed-income neighborhood, paying $1,200 per month. The couple has no children but is planning to start a family soon, which is a significant factor in their economic concerns, particularly regarding healthcare access and education costs.\n\nAlejandro's immigration status and lack of U.S. citizenship also influence his political views, as he advocates for more inclusive immigration policies and pathways to citizenship. His economic priorities include affordable healthcare, better job opportunities, and access to higher education for himself and his future family. Despite the challenges, Alejandro is committed to building a life in the United States and contributing to his community, hoping for a more secure future."
