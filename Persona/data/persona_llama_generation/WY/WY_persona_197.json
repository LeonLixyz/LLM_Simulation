  "PERSONA": "Meet 79-year-old Ethan Tanaka, a White and Asian male, living in the scenic town of Jackson, Wyoming, with his long-term partner. Born in California, Ethan has called Wyoming home for the past 15 years, drawn by its natural beauty and a more relaxed pace of life. As the spouse of the household, Ethan lives with his partner, Rachel, a retired school teacher who is the primary breadwinner. They share a cozy, two-bedroom home in a quiet neighborhood near the town center, which they own outright, having paid off the mortgage several years ago.\n\nEthan holds an Associate's degree in Environmental Conservation from a community college in California, which he obtained in his mid-twenties. Although he never pursued a career directly in conservation, his education instilled in him a deep appreciation for nature, leading him to work as a park ranger for 25 years. He started in California state parks and later transferred to Wyoming, where he worked until his retirement at 65.\n\nEthan has never married, choosing instead to commit to a long-term partnership with Rachel, whom he met through mutual friends. Together, they have no children, but they are close to Rachel's nieces and nephews, who visit them regularly. This family structure has allowed Ethan to maintain a sense of independence while still enjoying the companionship and support of a partner.\n\nEthan's economic situation is relatively stable, with a modest pension from his years as a park ranger and some investments that provide a steady income stream. He and Rachel live comfortably on their combined income, with Rachel's teacher's pension being the larger of the two. They prioritize saving for healthcare expenses, as Ethan has some chronic health issues that require regular monitoring and treatment.\n\nGiven his background in conservation, Ethan is deeply concerned about environmental issues, particularly the impact of climate change on Wyoming's natural landscapes. He is also keenly interested in policies affecting seniors, such as healthcare costs and social security benefits. Despite his retirement, Ethan remains active in his community, volunteering at a local wildlife rehabilitation center and participating in town hall meetings on issues affecting Jackson's growth and development.\n\nEthan's decision to settle in Wyoming reflects his desire for a more peaceful life, away from the hustle and bustle of city living. However, this choice also means he is keenly aware of the economic challenges faced by rural communities, including limited job opportunities and access to healthcare services. These concerns influence his political views, as he seeks leaders who understand the unique needs of rural areas and are committed to preserving America's natural beauty for future generations."
