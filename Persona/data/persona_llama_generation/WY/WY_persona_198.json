  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 39-year-old White male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder in a married-couple household without kids, residing in a moderate-sized, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. Ryan has been married to his wife, Emily, for eight years. They met while attending community college and have been together ever since.\n\nRyan was born in Colorado but moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age. He holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Laramie County Community College, which has served him well in his career as a Service Manager at a local car dealership. He earns a stable income of $62,000 per year, allowing him and his wife to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nRyan and Emily own their home, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house with a small backyard, which they purchased five years ago for $270,000. They have a combined monthly mortgage payment of $1,800, which accounts for about 30% of their joint income. They also have two cars, a 2018 Ford F-150 and a 2020 Honda Civic, which Ryan takes pride in maintaining himself.\n\nRyan's primary economic concerns include saving for retirement, as he feels he started saving too late, and managing the increasing cost of healthcare. He is also worried about the impact of potential policy changes on his job security and the overall automotive industry. He and his wife are considering starting a family in the near future, which adds to their desire for financial stability.\n\nRyan is fluent in English and has no known disabilities. He is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. He and his wife enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking and camping, and often take advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty on the weekends."
