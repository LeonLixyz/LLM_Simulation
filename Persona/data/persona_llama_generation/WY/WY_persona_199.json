  "PERSONA": "Meet 62-year-old Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a White female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides with her elderly parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, taking on significant caregiving responsibilities. As a never-married individual, Alex's focus has been on her career and family obligations. \n\nAlex holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained after completing her undergraduate studies in the same field. Her educational background has been instrumental in her career as an Environmental Consultant for a private firm specializing in sustainable practices for local businesses and government agencies. Her job title is Senior Sustainability Advisor, and she earns an annual salary of $85,000. \n\nGiven her profession, Alex is deeply concerned about environmental policies, particularly those affecting Wyoming's natural resources and wildlife conservation. Her economic priorities include job security, affordable healthcare for her aging parents, and the impact of federal policies on local businesses in her community. \n\nAlex speaks English fluently and has lived in Wyoming her entire life, which has instilled in her a strong sense of community and local pride. Her household income is supplemented by her parents' retirement pensions, allowing for a relatively comfortable lifestyle. However, the burden of caregiving and the rising costs of healthcare for her parents are significant concerns that influence her economic and political views.\n\nAssumptions made based on missing information include: \n- HOUSEHOLD_TYPE is assumed to be a single-family home, given the household relationship and the need for space to accommodate her parents.\n- ETHNICITY is assumed to be non-Hispanic, given the lack of information suggesting otherwise and the individual's birthplace within the United States."
