  "PERSONA": "Alejandro \"Alex\" Morales is a 38-year-old, US-born male of mixed Native American and Mexican ancestry, residing in Casper, Wyoming. He lives alone in a rented, one-bedroom apartment in a modest neighborhood, with a monthly rent of $600. As the primary householder, Alex is responsible for all household expenses.\n\nAlex holds a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Wyoming. He graduated in 2008 but struggled to find stable employment in his field due to the economic downturn. After a series of internships and part-time jobs, Alex secured a full-time position as a manufacturing supervisor at a local oil equipment factory in 2012. He earns an annual salary of $9,200, which places him below the federal poverty line for a single person. Despite his low income, Alex values the job security and benefits that come with his position, including private health insurance through his employer.\n\nAs a single male without kids, Alex's primary economic concerns are affording basic necessities, paying off student loans, and saving for retirement. He allocates 30% of his income towards rent, 20% towards utilities and groceries, and 15% towards his student loan debt. Alex's financial situation forces him to be frugal, relying on public transportation, cooking at home, and canceling non-essential expenses.\n\nAlex's limited financial resources influence his political views, making him more likely to support policies that address income inequality, affordable housing, and access to affordable healthcare. He is also concerned about the environmental impact of the oil industry, which employs many in his community, and seeks a balance between economic growth and environmental protection.\n\nDespite the challenges he faces, Alex remains optimistic about his future, hoping to one day start his own sustainable manufacturing business. He spends his free time volunteering at a local community garden, where he meets like-minded individuals who share his passion for environmental stewardship and social justice."
