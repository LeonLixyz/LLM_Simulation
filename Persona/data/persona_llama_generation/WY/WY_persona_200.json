  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson is an 18-year-old, white female who resides in the small town of Lander, Wyoming, with her parents. She was born in Wyoming and is a U.S. citizen by birthright. Alex is currently married, but her husband is temporarily away for work, and they are not separated by choice but by circumstance. \n\nShe is a high school student, specifically in the 11th grade, but does not yet have a diploma. Alex's educational path has been slightly disrupted due to her marriage and the need to balance school with family responsibilities. She speaks English fluently and has no known ethnic affiliations.\n\nAlex's family lives in a single-family home in a rural area just outside of Lander, which they own. Her parents work in the local tourism industry, with her mother being a part-time waitress at a diner and her father working as a guide for a small, family-owned outfitter. Their household income is around $55,000 annually, which is considered middle-class in their area.\n\nGiven her situation, Alex's economic concerns are primarily centered around finishing her education while navigating her new role as a married individual. She hopes to eventually pursue a career in healthcare, possibly as a nurse, which would require her to complete a degree after high school. Her immediate economic priorities include supporting her family, managing the household while her husband is away, and saving for college. Alex's political views are likely influenced by her rural upbringing and the economic challenges faced by her community, such as access to quality education and job opportunities in Wyoming."
