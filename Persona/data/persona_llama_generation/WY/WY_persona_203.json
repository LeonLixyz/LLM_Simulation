  "PERSONA": "Meet 39-year-old Ethan Thompson, a US-born citizen of mixed White and Native American descent, who currently resides in a homeless shelter in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ethan is married but separated from his wife, Rachel, due to financial instability and housing insecurity. They have a 7-year-old son, Lucas, who lives with his mother in a nearby town.\n\nEthan graduated from high school in his hometown in Montana and moved to Wyoming in his early twenties for better job opportunities. He speaks English fluently and has no known language barriers. Before becoming homeless, Ethan worked as a carpenter's assistant, earning approximately $35,000 per year. However, the construction industry's seasonal fluctuations and his lack of advanced education limited his career growth and financial stability.\n\nEthan's economic concerns revolve around finding stable employment, securing affordable housing, and reuniting with his family. He relies on local non-profit organizations and government assistance programs to get back on his feet. As a result, Ethan is likely to support policies that address homelessness, affordable housing initiatives, and job training programs that can help him regain stability and provide for his family.\n\nEthan's experience with homelessness has also made him more aware of the need for accessible healthcare and mental health services. He has been utilizing the services of a local community clinic to manage his anxiety and depression. Consequently, Ethan would likely advocate for policies that expand access to affordable healthcare, mental health support, and social services for low-income individuals and families.\n\nGiven his situation, Ethan is highly interested in local and state-level politics, particularly policies that directly impact his life, such as affordable housing initiatives, job training programs, and access to social services. His experiences have also made him more empathetic towards others struggling with similar challenges, and he is likely to support politicians who prioritize the needs of low-income families and individuals."
