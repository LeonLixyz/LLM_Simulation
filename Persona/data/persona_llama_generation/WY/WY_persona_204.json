  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 29-year-old white female, lives with her parents in a suburban area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan, who works as a mechanic. They do not have any children, but are planning to start a family soon. Emily's marital status is reflected in her decision to move back in with her parents temporarily, as they are saving up to purchase their own home.\n\nEmily holds an associate's degree in business administration but did not complete her bachelor's degree due to financial constraints. She currently works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance firm, earning around $35,000 per year. Her job is stable, but she hopes to secure a full-time position with better benefits to support her growing family.\n\nAs a US-born citizen, Emily was born in California but moved to Wyoming with her family at a young age. She speaks English fluently and has no known ethnic affiliations. Her family has been living in Wyoming for over 15 years, and Emily considers it her home state.\n\nEmily's economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off her student loans, and planning for her future family's financial security. She is interested in local and national policies that support affordable housing, education, and job creation, as these issues directly impact her life and future plans."
