  "PERSONA": "Juan Hernandez, a 68-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, resides in a small suburban town near Casper, Wyoming. He lives with his parents in a single-family home that his family has owned for over 20 years. Juan is married to his high school sweetheart, Maria, and they have been together for over 40 years. Although his marital status indicates \"now married, except separated,\" in Juan's case, this means that he and Maria have been married for many years but have recently experienced a period of temporary separation due to health issues.\n\nJuan was born in Wyoming and has always called the state home. He is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently, having learned it as his primary language from a young age. He has a high school diploma from a local high school in Casper and pursued a career in the manufacturing sector, working as a quality control specialist at a local machinery factory for over 30 years before retiring early due to health concerns.\n\nJuan's economic situation is relatively stable, with a modest pension from his former employer and social security benefits. His combined household income is approximately $55,000 per year, which is sufficient to cover living expenses and support his parents, who also live in the household. The family's homeownership status helps keep costs relatively low, with a mortgage that was paid off several years ago.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Juan is deeply concerned about the local economy, particularly the decline of the manufacturing sector and its impact on young people's job prospects. He is also worried about the rising cost of healthcare and how it affects his family, given his health issues and his parents' advancing age. These concerns shape his economic and political views, making him more likely to support policies that promote local economic development, affordable healthcare, and social security benefits for retirees.\n\nJuan's educational background has had a significant impact on his career trajectory, as it provided him with the skills necessary to secure a stable job in the manufacturing sector. However, he wishes he had pursued higher education to improve his career prospects and earning potential.\n\nIn terms of family structure and responsibilities, Juan is deeply committed to caring for his aging parents, which has become a significant part of his daily life. He and Maria have two grown children who live elsewhere in the state, and they provide occasional financial support when needed.\n\nOverall, Juan's experiences and circumstances have shaped his economic and political views, making him a unique and informed individual within his demographic group."
