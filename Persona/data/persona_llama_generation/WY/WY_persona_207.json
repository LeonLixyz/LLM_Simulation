  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Maria Hernandez, a 57-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States, specifically in Arizona, but currently residing in a small town in Wyoming. She lives with her parents, both in their early eighties, in a single-family home in a rural area near Cheyenne. Ana Maria has never been married and has no children of her own.\n\nAna Maria's educational background consists of a high school diploma from a public school in Arizona, where she grew up. After completing high school, she moved to Wyoming to care for her aging parents and has been living there for over 20 years. Her English proficiency is excellent, as she has always spoken English as her primary language at home and in school.\n\nProfessionally, Ana Maria works part-time as a medical receptionist at a local clinic in Cheyenne, earning around $32,000 per year. Her job provides her with a stable income and benefits, allowing her to contribute to her parents' household expenses and care for them as needed. Ana Maria's work schedule is flexible, which is essential for her caregiving responsibilities.\n\nAna Maria's economic situation is relatively stable, but she is concerned about her parents' healthcare costs and the potential need for long-term care in the future. She has been saving a portion of her income in a separate savings account to prepare for these expenses. As a non-homeowner, Ana Maria does not have to worry about mortgage payments, but she does contribute to the household expenses, including utilities and groceries.\n\nLiving in a rural area, Ana Maria is aware of the challenges faced by her community, including limited access to healthcare services and job opportunities. She is concerned about the economic development of her town and the potential impact of policy changes on local businesses and residents. Ana Maria's economic priorities include affordable healthcare, job security, and support for caregivers like herself.\n\nIn her free time, Ana Maria enjoys volunteering at a local community center, where she helps with language classes for Spanish-speaking immigrants. She is proud of her Mexican heritage and values the opportunity to give back to her community. Ana Maria's experiences as a caregiver, part-time worker, and community volunteer have shaped her views on economic and political issues, making her a unique and valuable voice in her rural Wyoming community."
