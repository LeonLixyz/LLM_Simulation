  "PERSONA": "Meet Jamal Reed, a 38-year-old male, identifying as multiracial (White and Black or African American), living in Cheyenne, the capital city of Wyoming. Jamal resides with his parents in a single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood. This living arrangement is partly due to the economic challenges he faces, which make it difficult for him to afford independent housing.\n\nJamal is a high school graduate and has not pursued higher education. His educational background has led him to a career in the retail sector, where he works as a sales associate at a local sporting goods store. His annual income is approximately $32,000, which is modest but sufficient to support his personal expenses.\n\nAs a non-veteran who has never been married, Jamal's primary family responsibilities are towards his parents. He contributes to the household income and helps with daily chores. His parents, both in their early sixties, are semi-retired and work part-time jobs. Jamal's father works as a mechanic, while his mother is a part-time librarian. Their combined household income is around $60,000 per year.\n\nJamal's economic concerns are centered around saving enough money to move out of his parents' house and start his own family in the future. He is also interested in advancing his career, possibly by pursuing vocational training or an associate's degree in a field related to outdoor recreation, given his passion for the outdoors and his experience working at the sporting goods store.\n\nGeographically, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Jamal is influenced by the local economy, which is driven by the energy industry, tourism, and agriculture. He is concerned about the environmental impact of these industries and supports policies that promote sustainable development and conservation.\n\nJamal's lack of a college education and his modest income make him sensitive to economic policies that affect the working class, such as minimum wage laws, access to affordable healthcare, and education initiatives that could help him advance in his career. His experience living with his parents also makes him aware of the challenges faced by multigenerational households and the need for policies that support these families.\n\nAssumptions made based on the provided metadata include specifying Jamal's age as 38 (within the 35-44 range), his income, job title, and sector (based on his educational background and the need for a job that could support his lifestyle), and the assumption that his parents are semi-retired and work part-time (given their age and the need for a household income that allows Jamal to live with them)."
