  "PERSONA": "Henry \"Hank\" Thompson is an 87-year-old white male living in a small, single-story ranch-style house in a rural area just outside of Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder, he resides alone but is technically married, having been separated from his wife, Barbara, for over a decade due to her move to a nursing home in a nearby town to receive full-time care for her dementia. Hank visits her regularly but has grown accustomed to his solitary life.\n\nBorn in rural Oklahoma, Hank moved to Wyoming in his early twenties for work, drawn by the state's thriving coal mining industry. He worked as a coal miner for over three decades, eventually retiring in 2001 with a modest pension and social security benefits, which amount to approximately $2,500 per month. Despite his limited formal education, having completed only the 8th grade, Hank has always been resourceful and handy, skills he developed from a young age helping on his family's farm.\n\nHank owns his home outright, having paid off the mortgage years ago, but he does have a small property tax bill and insurance premiums to manage. He drives a 2015 Ford F-150, which he purchased new and has meticulously maintained. He has a strong sense of independence and prefers to handle tasks on his own, including yard work and minor home repairs.\n\nGiven his age and physical limitations, Hank's main economic concerns revolve around healthcare costs, particularly the expenses associated with Barbara's care, which are not fully covered by Medicare. He also worries about potential changes to social security and the rising costs of living, especially as they impact his fixed income. Despite these concerns, Hank remains optimistic and values his independence above all, reflecting the self-reliance that has defined his life.\n\nHank's voting habits are conservative, influenced by his upbringing and the cultural values of rural Wyoming. He prioritizes issues like gun rights, lower taxes, and minimal government intervention in personal affairs. However, his experience with the healthcare system through Barbara's illness has also made him keenly aware of the importance of accessible, affordable healthcare, a perspective that sometimes puts him at odds with traditional conservative stances on healthcare reform."
