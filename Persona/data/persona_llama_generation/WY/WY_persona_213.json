  "PERSONA": "A 28-year-old white female, living in a married-couple household with kids in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, Wyoming. She is the primary householder, although her marital status is listed as 'Never married,' indicating she might be in a domestic partnership or have an unconventional family arrangement. Her partner, a 30-year-old male, works as a welder in the oil and gas industry, while she is a part-time dental hygienist with a local clinic. They have two children, ages 4 and 6, who attend a local public school.\n\nShe was born in Wyoming and has lived in the state her entire life, which influences her strong sense of community and desire for local economic growth. Her household income is around $65,000 per year, with her contributing about $35,000 to the household through her part-time job. The family rents a three-bedroom house for $1,200 per month, which is relatively affordable in the area.\n\nShe attended Casper College for two years, studying dental hygiene before dropping out to care for her first child. Her education has given her a stable, part-time career that allows her to balance work and family responsibilities. She is fluent in English and has no known disabilities.\n\nHer primary economic concerns are affordable childcare, access to quality education for her children, and job security in the face of the fluctuating oil and gas industry. She is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to family support, education, and economic diversification for the state of Wyoming."
