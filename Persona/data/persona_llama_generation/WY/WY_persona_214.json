  "PERSONA": "Evelyn Thompson, an 87-year-old white female, resides in a small town in Wyoming with her husband, Richard. They have been married for 62 years and have no children. As the primary householder, Evelyn takes care of the household chores and manages the family's finances. \n\nEvelyn was born in Iowa but has lived in Wyoming for the past 40 years, where she and her husband moved after he retired from his job as a mechanic. They own a modest, single-story home on the outskirts of Cody, Wyoming, which they purchased in 1985 for $120,000. The current market value of their home is around $280,000. \n\nEvelyn attended a local community college in Iowa for two years, studying business administration, but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. She worked part-time as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company until her husband's retirement, when she decided to focus on taking care of their home and volunteering at the local library. \n\nAs a homemaker, Evelyn's primary economic concerns are managing the household expenses, maintaining their home, and ensuring they have sufficient retirement savings. She and her husband live on a fixed income, which includes his pension and their combined social security benefits, totaling around $55,000 per year. Evelyn's husband suffers from mild dementia, and she is his primary caregiver, which adds to her economic concerns and responsibilities. \n\nEvelyn is fluent in English and has no known disabilities. Her English proficiency has been helpful in managing the household finances, communicating with healthcare professionals, and staying engaged with her community through volunteering. As a lifelong US citizen, Evelyn values her civic duties and regularly votes in local and national elections, prioritizing issues related to healthcare, social security, and affordable housing for seniors."
