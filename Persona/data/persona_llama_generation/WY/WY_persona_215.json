  "PERSONA": "John Harris, a 69-year-old white male, has been a long-time resident of Wyoming, specifically living in the suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, the state's capital. Born in Nebraska, John moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age. He is a high school graduate from Cheyenne's East High School and has been married to his wife, Susan, for 43 years. They met while Susan was working as a nurse at the local hospital, and John was working as a mechanic at a nearby garage.\n\nJohn's current household consists of himself and his wife. They have two grown children who have moved out of the house, both of whom are married with kids of their own. Their eldest son lives in nearby Fort Collins, Colorado, and works as an engineer, while their daughter resides in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and is a teacher at the local elementary school.\n\nJohn's wife, Susan, is the primary breadwinner in the household. She works as a part-time nurse at the Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, earning around $55,000 per year. John, on the other hand, is semi-retired. He works part-time as a handyman and repairman, taking on small projects for neighbors and acquaintances, bringing in an additional $20,000 per year. They own their home, a cozy 3-bedroom house in the suburbs, which they purchased 25 years ago for $120,000. The house is now valued at around $350,000.\n\nJohn's primary economic concerns include the rising cost of healthcare, as he and his wife are getting older and require more medical attention. He is also worried about the increasing property taxes in their neighborhood, which might affect their ability to afford their home on their fixed income. Politically, John identifies as a moderate conservative and values local control, limited government intervention in personal matters, and a strong sense of community."
