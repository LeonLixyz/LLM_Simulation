  "PERSONA": "Ana Maria Hernandez, a 49-year-old Mexican-American woman, lives with her 70-year-old parents in a modest, two-story family home in the suburban area of Casper, Wyoming. After her husband's untimely death three years ago, Ana Maria moved back in with her parents to care for them and help with household expenses. Her father, a retired mechanic, and her mother, a part-time seamstress, appreciate the additional support.\n\nAna Maria works as a medical records clerk at a local healthcare facility, earning $43,000 annually. Her Associate's degree in Health Information Technology, obtained from Casper College, has served her well in this role. She is fluent in English, having been born and raised in Wyoming, but she still enjoys speaking Spanish with her parents and extended family.\n\nAs a widow, Ana Maria's economic priorities have shifted. She is now focused on paying off the mortgage on her late husband's family home, which she inherited. The house, valued at $220,000, has a mortgage of $180,000 with a monthly payment of $1,200. Ana Maria's income, combined with her parents' retirement benefits and part-time earnings, allows them to make ends meet, but they have to be mindful of their expenses.\n\nAna Maria's primary economic concerns are managing the household finances, ensuring her parents' well-being, and maintaining their family home. She is interested in local policies that support affordable housing, access to quality healthcare, and programs that benefit seniors and widowed individuals. Her experiences have made her more cautious and risk-averse, but she values financial security and independence."
