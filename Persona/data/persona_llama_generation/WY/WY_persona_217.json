  "PERSONA": "Meet 57-year-old Ethan Thompson, a White and Native American male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ethan is married to his wife, Sarah, and they reside with his 85-year-old mother, who requires care and assistance due to her advanced age. Ethan's marital status is married but separated, as he and Sarah are currently navigating the challenges of caring for his mother, which has put a strain on their relationship. They are not formally separated but are living apart, with Ethan staying in his childhood home to care for his mother, while Sarah resides in a nearby apartment due to the need for some personal space.\n\nEthan holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained after transferring from a community college in his home state. His educational background has allowed him to secure a stable job as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm, where he works 30 hours a week, earning $55,000 per year. This income, combined with his wife's part-time job as a librarian, provides them with a modest but sufficient household income.\n\nAs a homeowner, Ethan inherited his childhood home from his father, which has significantly reduced their housing costs. However, the house requires frequent maintenance, and Ethan often spends his free time performing repairs and renovations. He is proud of his DIY skills and enjoys working on projects around the house.\n\nEthan's primary economic concerns include ensuring his mother receives adequate care, managing the household expenses, and saving for his retirement. He is worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on his mother's care. He is also concerned about the local economy, as the decline of the coal industry has affected many of his friends and acquaintances.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ethan is deeply rooted in the local community and is passionate about environmental issues, particularly those affecting the state's natural resources. He is an avid outdoorsman and enjoys hiking and fishing in his free time. Ethan's economic and political views are shaped by his experiences as a caregiver, homeowner, and member of the local community, making him a unique and nuanced individual with specific concerns and priorities."
