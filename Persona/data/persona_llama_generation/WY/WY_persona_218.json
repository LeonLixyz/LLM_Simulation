  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Alejandro Morales, a US-born Mexican-American male residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Alejandro lives alone in a modest, rented apartment in the downtown area, close to his workplace. He has never been married and does not have any children. Alejandro's first language is Spanish, and while he has a basic understanding of English, he prefers to speak Spanish, especially at home and in his community. He holds a high school diploma from Cheyenne Central High School and has not pursued further formal education.\n\nAlejandro works as a maintenance technician at a local manufacturing plant, earning around $45,000 per year. His job requires him to be on-site, ensuring the machinery and equipment are in good working order. This role provides him with a sense of stability, and he values the hands-on nature of his work. He has been with the company for over five years and has seen minimal wage growth, which is a concern for him, especially considering the rising cost of living in Cheyenne.\n\nAs a renter, Alejandro pays around $900 per month for his one-bedroom apartment, which is relatively affordable compared to other parts of the city. However, he dreams of owning a home one day, which he believes would provide him with a sense of long-term security and stability. Alejandro's economic concerns are centered around saving for a down payment on a house, managing his expenses, and ensuring he has a secure job with opportunities for advancement.\n\nAlejandro's lack of proficiency in English has not significantly hindered his career advancement, as his job does not require extensive English language skills. However, he recognizes the importance of improving his English to access better job opportunities and engage more fully in his community. In his free time, Alejandro enjoys watching Mexican soccer and exploring the outdoors, often visiting the nearby Vedauwoo Recreation Area for hiking and camping trips.\n\nAlejandro's economic priorities are focused on financial stability, affordable housing, and job security. He is likely to support policies that promote affordable housing initiatives, job training programs, and economic development in Wyoming, particularly in the manufacturing sector."
