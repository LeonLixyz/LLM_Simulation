  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 57-year-old white female, born in Oregon but currently residing in Casper, Wyoming. She is the spouse of the household but has been separated from her husband, John, for about two years, although they have not yet finalized their divorce. Karen and John have two adult children, Emily and Michael, both in their early twenties, who no longer live at home. Emily is pursuing a degree in environmental science at the University of Wyoming, while Michael works as a freelance graphic designer.\n\nKaren's educational background includes two years of college at a community college in Oregon, where she studied early childhood education. However, she did not complete her degree due to family responsibilities and relocation. Despite this, she has managed to build a successful career in the education sector, currently working as a librarian at a local elementary school in Casper. Her job provides her with a stable income of $62,500 per year, which is supplemented by her husband's alimony payments of $10,000 annually.\n\nKaren's household income places her in a relatively comfortable position, but she still relies on public health insurance coverage due to the high costs of private insurance in Wyoming. She owns a modest, single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood in Casper, which she and her husband purchased in 2005. The current market value of the house is around $220,000, with an outstanding mortgage of $120,000.\n\nKaren's primary economic concerns revolve around retirement savings, as she feels that she has not saved enough for her golden years. She is also worried about her children's student loan debt and the rising costs of living in Wyoming. Politically, Karen leans towards moderate Democratic policies, particularly those related to education and healthcare. She is an avid supporter of public schools and believes that every citizen should have access to affordable healthcare.\n\nIn her free time, Karen enjoys hiking, reading, and volunteering at local literacy programs. She is fluent in English and has a strong sense of community involvement, often participating in local events and advocating for social causes that affect her community."
