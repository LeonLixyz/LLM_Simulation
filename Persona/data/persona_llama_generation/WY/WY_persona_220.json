  "PERSONA": "Juan Carlos Hernandez, a 49-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States but in a different state than his current residence. He is the primary householder in a married-couple household with children, although he has never been married himself, suggesting a domestic partnership or other arrangement. \n\nJuan Carlos lives in Casper, Wyoming, a city with a relatively low cost of living, which is beneficial for his household. He has an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Casper College, which he obtained after relocating to Wyoming for better job opportunities. He currently works as a Service Manager at a local car dealership, earning an annual salary of $58,000. His job involves managing a team of mechanics, coordinating with customers, and overseeing the day-to-day operations of the service department.\n\nJuan Carlos's household consists of his partner, Maria, and their two children, ages 10 and 12. Maria works part-time as a teacher's aide at a local elementary school. They own a modest, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood, with a mortgage of $1,200 per month. Their household income is around $70,000 annually, which allows them to cover their living expenses, save for their children's education, and enjoy some discretionary income.\n\nJuan Carlos is fluent in English, having grown up in the United States, but he still maintains strong ties to his Mexican heritage through cultural events and traditions. He is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. His economic concerns include saving for his children's college education, paying off their mortgage, and ensuring a stable financial future for his household. He is likely to be interested in policies that support education, job security, and affordable healthcare."
