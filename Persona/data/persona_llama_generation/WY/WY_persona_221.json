  "PERSONA": "Juan Hernandez, a 68-year-old Hispanic male of Puerto Rican ethnicity, is the primary householder in a cohabiting couple household without kids, residing in Casper, Wyoming. He has been married to his wife, Maria, for over 30 years, and they have been living together in Wyoming for the past 15 years after relocating from New York, where Juan was born and raised.\n\nJuan holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, which he obtained from the University at Albany, State University of New York. After graduating, he worked as a financial analyst for over 25 years in the private sector, primarily in the banking industry, before retiring five years ago. His career trajectory allowed him to accumulate a modest retirement fund and own a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, which he shares with his wife.\n\nJuan's household income is primarily composed of his retirement savings, social security benefits, and a part-time job as a financial advisor at a local credit union. His annual household income is approximately $65,000, with his part-time job contributing about $25,000 to that total.\n\nAs a homeowner, Juan is concerned about maintaining the value of his property and keeping up with mortgage payments, property taxes, and insurance costs. He has a mortgage balance of $120,000 on his home, which is valued at around $250,000. Juan's economic priorities include ensuring a stable retirement, managing healthcare costs, and maintaining a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nJuan and his wife, Maria, are both fluent in English, having learned the language from an early age. They are both US citizens by birth, with Juan being born in New York to Puerto Rican parents. Juan's birthplace in a different state, combined with his relocation to Wyoming, has given him a unique perspective on regional differences and the importance of adapting to new environments.\n\nJuan's lack of veteran status means he does not have access to certain benefits that might impact his economic situation or views on policy. However, as a retiree, he is keenly interested in policies affecting social security, healthcare, and taxation, particularly as they relate to his financial security and quality of life."
