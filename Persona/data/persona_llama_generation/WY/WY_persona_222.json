  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Sarah Jenkins, a white, US-born female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides with her parents in a single-family home in a working-class neighborhood. Sarah is not a veteran and has never been married. Her primary language is English, which she speaks well, although she has limited proficiency in reading and writing due to her educational background.\n\nSarah's highest level of education is 8th grade, which she completed at a local public school in Cheyenne. Due to financial constraints and family responsibilities, she did not pursue further education. This educational attainment significantly impacts her career trajectory and economic situation.\n\nSarah works as a part-time retail sales associate at a local department store, earning approximately $22,000 per year. Her job does not offer benefits, and she relies on her parents for some financial support. She is not a homeowner and does not have any immediate plans to pursue homeownership due to her financial situation.\n\nAs a child living with her parents, Sarah contributes to household expenses, including rent and utilities, but her parents cover the majority of the costs. Her family's economic situation is modest, with a combined household income of around $50,000 per year.\n\nSarah's economic concerns revolve around job security, affordable healthcare, and access to education and training programs that could improve her career prospects. She is likely to prioritize policies addressing income inequality, affordable education, and job creation in her region. Her experiences and circumstances make her more likely to support local economic development initiatives and social programs aimed at assisting low-income families.\n\nGiven her limited education and economic situation, Sarah may face challenges navigating complex policy issues but is likely to engage with local politics and support candidates who address her immediate economic concerns and the needs of her community."
