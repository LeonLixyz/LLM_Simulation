  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Denver, Colorado, she moved to Wyoming 10 years ago with her husband, Michael, who secured a job as a mechanical engineer in the energy sector. Alex is married and currently resides with her parents in a suburban area of Cheyenne due to financial constraints. She has a step-daughter, Emma, from Michael's previous marriage, who lives with them part-time.\n\nAssuming Alex's household type is a multi-generational household, given her living situation with her parents, she shares the household responsibilities, contributing to the family income and helping with household chores.\n\nAlex attended Casper College, where she studied business administration for two years before dropping out due to financial constraints. She now works part-time as a customer service representative at a local bank, earning $35,000 per year. Her husband's income, combined with hers, totals around $80,000 annually. They are currently saving to purchase a home, hoping to move out of her parents' house within the next two years.\n\nGiven her income and living situation, Alex's primary economic concerns include affordable housing, access to quality education for her step-daughter, and job security. She values healthcare and social security, as her mother has been dealing with chronic illness, and Alex has taken on a caregiving role.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex is familiar with the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and is concerned about the impact of economic fluctuations on her husband's job and the local community. Her experiences living with her parents and managing the household have made her more cautious about spending and more supportive of policies promoting affordable housing, education, and job security."
