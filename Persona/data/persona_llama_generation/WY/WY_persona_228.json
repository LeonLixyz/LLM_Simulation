  "PERSONA": "Alex Thompson, a 22-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Alex shares a modest, rented two-bedroom apartment with his partner, Emily, whom he has been in a committed relationship with for three years. Despite being in a long-term partnership, Alex and Emily have chosen not to get married, reflecting their independent and somewhat unconventional views on traditional institutions.\n\nAlex was born in Denver, Colorado, but moved to Wyoming with his family at the age of 10. He considers himself a Wyoming native, having spent most of his formative years in the state. After graduating from Cheyenne East High School, Alex attended Laramie County Community College, where he studied business administration for two years before deciding to enter the workforce. \n\nCurrently, Alex works as a sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, earning an annual income of $38,000. His job allows him to interact with the community, share his passion for the outdoors, and maintain a flexible schedule that accommodates his partner's work hours. Emily, who works as a part-time graphic designer, contributes to their household income, which totals around $60,000 per year.\n\nAlex's economic concerns are centered around saving for the future, particularly for a down payment on a house. He and Emily aspire to become homeowners within the next five years, which motivates Alex to be mindful of his spending habits and look for ways to increase his income. He is also interested in local environmental issues, such as conservation efforts and sustainable land use, which often influence his political views and voting decisions.\n\nGiven his background and current situation, Alex values economic policies that support small businesses, promote affordable housing, and prioritize environmental protection. As a young, educated, and environmentally conscious individual, Alex is likely to engage in local politics and advocate for policies that align with his values and aspirations."
