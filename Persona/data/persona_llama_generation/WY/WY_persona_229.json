  "PERSONA": "Margaret \"Meg\" Thompson, a 69-year-old white female, born in Oregon, USA, but has resided in Cheyenne, Wyoming, for the past 25 years. She is married to her second husband, John, a 72-year-old retired accountant, and they live in a two-story, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood with a mix of single-family homes and small apartment complexes. They purchased their home in 2002 for $190,000 and have since made significant improvements, increasing its value to around $350,000.\n\nMeg holds a Master's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in 1998. Before retiring in 2015, she worked as a school counselor at a local high school for 15 years, earning an annual salary of around $60,000. Her husband's retirement income from his accounting firm, combined with her own pension and part-time consulting work, provides them with a comfortable annual household income of approximately $90,000.\n\nAs a spouse of a householder, Meg's daily life revolves around supporting her husband, managing the household, and engaging in volunteer work. She spends her free time reading, gardening, and participating in local community events. Despite being a non-veteran, Meg's late brother was a Vietnam War veteran, and she actively supports local veteran organizations.\n\nMeg's economic concerns include the rising cost of healthcare, potential changes to Social Security, and the increasing property taxes in her neighborhood. As a homeowner, she is keenly aware of the impact of local policies on her household budget and the overall quality of life in her community. Her educational background and experience as a school counselor have instilled in her a strong appreciation for the importance of accessible education and healthcare, influencing her views on economic and political issues."
