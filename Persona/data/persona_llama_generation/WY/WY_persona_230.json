  "PERSONA": "A 57-year-old white male named Ryan Thompson, who was born in Idaho but currently resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state's capital. He is married but separated, and his wife, Sarah, lives in a separate residence in the same city. Ryan has no children. He has a relatively small household, living alone in a rented, two-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. His annual rent is $1,200 per month, which is approximately 30% of his gross income.\n\nRyan attended a local community college in Idaho for two years, studying business administration but did not graduate. Despite not having a college degree, he has managed to secure a stable job as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Cheyenne, where he earns $48,000 per year. His job involves managing office operations, coordinating events, and providing customer support. Ryan has been working at this company for the past five years and has a decent understanding of the insurance industry.\n\nAs a primary householder, Ryan is responsible for all household expenses, including rent, utilities, groceries, and transportation. He owns a 2018 Toyota Corolla, which he uses to commute to work and run errands. Ryan's economic concerns include saving for retirement, as he does not have a pension plan through his employer and is worried about his financial security in the long term. He is also concerned about the rising cost of healthcare, as he has a pre-existing medical condition that requires regular treatment.\n\nRyan is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. He speaks English fluently and has no known proficiency in any other language. In his free time, Ryan enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing, which Wyoming's natural landscapes readily provide. He is moderately engaged in local politics, often voting in state and national elections, and has a general interest in economic policies that affect small businesses and the local community."
