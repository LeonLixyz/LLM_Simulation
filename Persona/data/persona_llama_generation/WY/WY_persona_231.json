  "PERSONA": "Meet Deborah Johnson, a 57-year-old White female, born in the United States, specifically in the state of Montana, but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of her household, despite being divorced, indicating she is the head of her residence. Deborah lives in a married-couple household without kids, suggesting her divorce is recent or she has an arrangement with her ex-partner that allows them to cohabitate for financial or practical reasons, but she maintains primary control over the household.\n\nDeborah holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from a local community college in Wyoming, which she obtained after moving to the state about a decade ago. Her educational background has equipped her with skills in accounting and management, allowing her to secure a job as an administrative assistant at a small, locally-owned insurance firm in Cheyenne. Her annual income is approximately $42,000, which is slightly above the median for her position and location.\n\nAs a non-veteran and U.S. citizen by birth, Deborah's life experiences are deeply rooted in her community and the economic realities of small-town Wyoming. She speaks English fluently and has never spoken any other language at home, reflecting her upbringing in a predominantly English-speaking environment.\n\nDeborah owns a modest, single-family home in a suburban area of Cheyenne, with a mortgage that she has been diligently paying off over the past 15 years. Her home is valued at approximately $220,000, which is average for the area. She takes pride in being a homeowner and views it as a significant achievement and a symbol of stability.\n\nHer divorce, however, has introduced new economic challenges. Deborah's ex-husband, though still living in the house, contributes minimally to household expenses due to his own financial struggles. As a result, Deborah has become acutely aware of the need for policies that support single-income households and homeowners facing financial hardship. She is particularly concerned about healthcare costs, as she has seen her insurance premiums rise significantly over the past few years, affecting her ability to save for retirement.\n\nDeborah's economic concerns and priorities revolve around securing affordable healthcare, managing the rising costs of living in Wyoming, and ensuring that her home remains a stable financial asset. Her experiences as a divorced woman managing a household on her own have also made her advocate for stronger support systems for single-parent or single-income households."
