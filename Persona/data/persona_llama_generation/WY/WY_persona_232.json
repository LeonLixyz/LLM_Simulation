  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 28-year-old white female living in a suburban area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married and resides with her husband and parents in a single-family home owned by her parents. Emily's husband, Michael, is a 30-year-old high school sweetheart who works as an electrical engineer at a local manufacturing plant.\n\nEmily is a high school graduate, having attended Cheyenne's East High School. After graduation, she attended a local community college for a year but did not complete her degree. She currently works as a part-time administrative assistant at a dental clinic in downtown Cheyenne, earning $25,000 per year. Her flexible work schedule allows her to help care for her 2-year-old son, Jackson.\n\nEmily's parents, both in their mid-50s, are influential in her life. Her father is a retired mechanic, and her mother works part-time as a librarian at a local elementary school. Emily's decision to live with her parents stems from the rising cost of living in Cheyenne and the need for support in childcare.\n\nThe family owns a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house in a suburban neighborhood with a mix of young families and retirees. The property, valued at around $280,000, has been in the family for over a decade.\n\nEmily's primary economic concerns revolve around affording childcare, saving for her son's education, and eventually moving into her own home. She is interested in local politics, particularly policies affecting education, family support services, and affordable housing. Emily's views on economic policies are shaped by her experiences as a working mother, her family's financial situation, and her desire for a more secure future for her son."
