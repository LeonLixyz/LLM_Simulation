  "PERSONA": "Meet 49-year-old Karen Thompson, a white female who has been struggling to get back on her feet after a series of unfortunate events. Born in Oklahoma, Karen moved to Wyoming about a decade ago, seeking a fresh start. She resides in a homeless shelter in Casper, Wyoming's second-largest city, which has a relatively low cost of living but limited job opportunities.\n\nKaren's educational background is marked by challenges; she attended high school in Oklahoma but dropped out in the 11th grade due to family issues. Despite not having a high school diploma, Karen has always been keen on learning and has since taken several vocational courses in hospitality and customer service. \n\nShe was married for about 10 years and has two children, now 19 and 21 years old, who live with their father in Oklahoma. Karen's divorce, which occurred about 5 years ago, significantly impacted her financial stability, and she has been homeless for the past year due to a combination of unemployment and unaffordable housing costs.\n\nBefore becoming homeless, Karen worked as a part-time waitress at a local diner, earning about $18,000 per year. However, she lost her job due to the diner's closure and has been unable to find stable employment since. She currently receives $800 per month in child support from her ex-husband, which is her primary source of income. \n\nKaren's top economic concerns include finding affordable housing, securing a stable job that can support her, and accessing affordable healthcare. She is a US citizen, speaks English fluently, and has been actively seeking assistance from local non-profit organizations to get back on her feet."
