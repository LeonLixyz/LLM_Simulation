  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 22-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, born and raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder in a married-couple household without children, residing in a modest, one-story home in a suburban neighborhood. Juan is married to his 21-year-old wife, Maria, whom he met in high school. They tied the knot a year ago, after saving up for a small, intimate wedding with close family and friends.\n\nJuan's educational background consists of a high school diploma from Cheyenne's East High School, where he graduated with a 3.2 GPA. He was an average student, but his passion for hands-on work led him to focus on vocational training in automotive repair. After high school, Juan landed a job as a mechanic at a local car dealership, where he earns $38,000 per year. He works 40 hours a week, with occasional overtime during peak seasons.\n\nJuan's wife, Maria, is currently pursuing an associate's degree in early childhood education at Laramie County Community College. She works part-time as a waitress at a local diner, earning around $18,000 per year. The couple's combined income allows them to make ends meet, with some room for saving and recreational activities.\n\nTheir home, a 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom house, is valued at $220,000. Juan and Maria purchased it two years ago with the help of a first-time homebuyer program, which offered a low-interest mortgage and down payment assistance. They pay $1,400 per month in mortgage payments, property taxes, and insurance.\n\nJuan's primary economic concerns revolve around paying off his mortgage, saving for Maria's education expenses, and building a stable financial future. He is interested in exploring options for retirement savings and potentially starting a family in the next five years. As a resident of Wyoming, Juan is also concerned about the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and the potential impact of fluctuations in the oil and gas market on his job security.\n\nIn his free time, Juan enjoys working on his 2007 Ford F-150, watching football, and spending time with his family. He is a proud supporter of the Denver Broncos and often attends local high school football games to cheer on his alma mater."
