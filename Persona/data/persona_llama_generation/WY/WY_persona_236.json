  "PERSONA": "Alex Thompson, a 38-year-old male, born in Denver, Colorado, but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Emily, a Wyoming native, whom he met during his graduate studies at the University of Wyoming. Alex identifies as White and Native American (enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation), reflecting his mixed heritage from his mother's side.\n\nAlex holds a Master's degree in Environmental Engineering from the University of Wyoming and works as a Senior Environmental Consultant for a private firm specializing in water resource management. His annual income is $83,000. Emily, his spouse, is a high school teacher, earning $55,000 annually. Together, they have two children: a 7-year-old son, Jackson, and a 4-year-old daughter, Ava.\n\nThe Thompsons own a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they purchased in 2018 for $280,000. Their monthly mortgage payment is $1,800, and they also pay $150 for property taxes and $80 for homeowners insurance.\n\nAs a family, they prioritize economic stability, affordable education, and access to quality healthcare. Alex is particularly concerned about the impact of climate change on Wyoming's water resources and the state's economy, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels. He supports policies that promote sustainable development, renewable energy, and environmental protection.\n\nThe Thompsons are active in their community, with Alex coaching Jackson's Little League team and Emily volunteering at the local food bank. They value their close-knit community and the outdoor recreational opportunities that Wyoming provides. Alex's experience as a consultant has given him a nuanced understanding of the state's economic challenges, and he is eager to contribute to discussions about Wyoming's economic future.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Based on the household relationship and marital status, it is assumed that Alex is part of a nuclear family with his spouse and children.\n- Given Alex's education and profession, it is assumed that he has a relatively stable and well-paying job, which is consistent with his income level.\n- The specific location within Wyoming (Cheyenne) was chosen due to its status as the state capital and a hub for professionals in various fields, including environmental consulting."
