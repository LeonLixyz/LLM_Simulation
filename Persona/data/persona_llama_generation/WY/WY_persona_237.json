They have been together for over a decade but have chosen not to get married. John is a US-born citizen and a veteran who served in the Army for six years before being honorably discharged.\n\nJohn holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Casper College, which he earned after his military service.

John is an avid hunter and enjoys exploring Wyoming's wilderness areas during his free time.\n\nAs a veteran, John receives some benefits, including access to the VA healthcare system and a reduced-interest mortgage option, which he hopes to utilize in the future when he and Emily decide to purchase a home. John's economic concerns include the rising costs of healthcare, the stability of his job in the face of technological advancements in the automotive industry, and the need for better infrastructure in rural Wyoming.\n\nJohn's educational background has served him well in his career, but he wishes he had pursued a Bachelor's degree, which he believes would have opened up more opportunities for advancement. Despite this, he is content with his current situation and values the work-life balance he has achieved. John's experience as a veteran and his involvement in the local community have instilled in him a strong sense of civic duty, leading him to be an active voter and participant in local politics."
