  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old white female, is the primary household holder of a married-couple family with kids, despite being never married herself. She resides in a small town in Wyoming, specifically in the rural outskirts of Cheyenne, where she was born and raised. Due to her limited education, having only completed 8th grade, Alex had to enter the workforce early. She works as a part-time waitress at a local diner, earning approximately $18,000 per year. Her partner, who she considers her common-law spouse, works full-time in the oil industry, bringing home around $60,000 annually. Together, they have two children, ages 4 and 2.\n\nAssuming Alex's partner's income is the primary source of household income, and considering her own earnings, their combined household income is roughly $78,000 per year. They rent a modest, three-bedroom house on the outskirts of town for $900 per month. Given her limited education, Alex's economic concerns often revolve around making ends meet, affording quality childcare, and the possibility of furthering her education to improve her career prospects and contribute more substantially to the household income.\n\nAs the primary household holder, despite not being married, Alex takes care of the children and manages the household. Her daily life is a balance between work, parenting, and managing the family's tight budget. She speaks English fluently and has no known disabilities. Her family relies on her partner's health insurance from his job, but she often worries about the future and the stability of their economic situation, especially in the face of Wyoming's fluctuating energy industry, which significantly impacts local job security.\n\nAlex's political views might lean toward policies supporting low-income families, affordable education, and job security, as these directly affect her life and the well-being of her family. Her experience as a young, single mother in a common-law marriage might also influence her stance on social welfare programs and family law."
