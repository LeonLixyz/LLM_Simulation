  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old White male, born in the United States, specifically in the state of Montana. He currently resides in the small town of Cody, Wyoming, where he works as a police sergeant, supervising a team of law enforcement officers. Ryan holds an Associate's degree in Criminal Justice from a local community college, which he completed before joining the police force 10 years ago.\n\nRyan is a widower; his wife passed away three years ago due to a long illness. He has a 9-year-old son, Ethan, from this marriage, and they share a cozy, two-bedroom house on the outskirts of Cody, which they own. Ryan's annual income is $29,500, which is supplemented by his late wife's life insurance policy. He has private health insurance coverage through his employer, which also covers his son.\n\nRyan's day begins early, with a 5:00 AM workout at the local gym, followed by a quick breakfast before dropping off Ethan at school. He then heads to the police station for his 8-hour shift, which often involves patrolling the town, responding to emergencies, and collaborating with his team on ongoing cases. Despite the challenges of his job, Ryan finds it rewarding and values the sense of community and camaraderie that comes with serving and protecting the people of Cody.\n\nRyan's economic concerns include saving for Ethan's education, paying off the remaining mortgage on their house, and building a secure financial future as a single parent. He is also concerned about the impact of rising healthcare costs on his insurance premiums and the potential for changes in law enforcement funding, which could affect his job security.\n\nIn his free time, Ryan enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and fishing, which are plentiful in Wyoming's natural landscapes. He is also involved in local community events, such as the annual Cody Stampede, where he participates in the parade and helps with security. Ryan's experiences as a widowed father and law enforcement officer have instilled in him a strong sense of responsibility and community spirit, shaping his economic and political views towards practical, family-oriented policies that support working-class Americans and small-town communities."
