  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old white female, born and raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a high school graduate, having completed her education at Cheyenne East High School in 2020. Despite her young age, Alex is divorced, having had a brief marriage that ended in 2022 due to irreconcilable differences.\n\nAlex lives with her parents in a single-family home in the suburbs of Cheyenne, where she contributes to household expenses by working part-time as a barista at a local coffee shop. Her annual income is approximately $25,000, which she supplements by taking online surveys and participating in gig economy jobs. Her parents, both in their mid-50s, are supportive and help with living expenses when needed.\n\nAs a non-veteran and child of non-veterans, Alex has no direct experience with military life. Her language proficiency is solely in English, which she speaks fluently, having grown up in a monolingual household.\n\nGiven her family situation and financial constraints, Alex's primary economic concerns revolve around finding stable employment, paying off debts from her short-lived marriage, and saving for higher education or vocational training. She is uncertain about her long-term career goals but is considering pursuing a degree in hospitality management or a related field.\n\nAlex's family dynamics and living situation influence her economic priorities, as she seeks to become financially independent while navigating her relationship with her parents. Her marital status and experience with divorce may also shape her views on social welfare policies, particularly those related to family support and education."
