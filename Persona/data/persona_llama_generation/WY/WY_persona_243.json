  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Maya Thompson, a biracial woman of White and Black or African American descent, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She shares a home with her widowed aunt in a moderate-income neighborhood near downtown. Maya's aunt, who owns the house, is a retired school teacher, and Maya contributes to the household expenses by paying a portion of the mortgage and utilities.\n\nMaya holds an Associate's degree in Healthcare Administration from Laramie County Community College, which she obtained in 2008. After serving four years in the US Army as a Medical Specialist, she transitioned into a civilian career, leveraging her experience to secure a job as a medical office manager at a local clinic in Cheyenne. She earns an annual salary of $55,000 and has been working at the clinic for seven years.\n\nAs a veteran, Maya has access to VA benefits, which she utilizes for medical care and education assistance. She has never been married and does not have children, allowing her to focus on her career and personal interests. Maya's aunt, who raised her after her mother passed away when she was a teenager, remains a significant influence in her life, and the two share household responsibilities.\n\nMaya's economic concerns center around saving for retirement, as she has limited financial resources set aside due to prioritizing her aunt's well-being and her own student loan debt. She is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly the increasing housing costs, which might affect her ability to continue contributing to her aunt's mortgage.\n\nMaya is fluent in English, having grown up speaking it as her primary language. Born in Georgia, she moved to Wyoming with her aunt after her mother's passing and has since developed strong ties to the community. As a result, Maya is invested in local politics, particularly issues related to veterans' affairs, healthcare, and affordable housing."
