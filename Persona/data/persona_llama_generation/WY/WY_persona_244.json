  "PERSONA": "John, a 68-year-old White male, lives in a small town in Wyoming with his long-term partner, whom he considers his spouse despite never having officially married. As the primary householder, John takes pride in maintaining their modest, single-story home on the outskirts of town, which they own outright after paying off the mortgage a decade ago. \n\nJohn was born in Montana but has lived in Wyoming for over 30 years, making him a familiar face in the community. He is a high school graduate from a local school in Wyoming and never pursued higher education due to family responsibilities and financial constraints. However, he values education and encourages others, especially the younger generation, to pursue their educational goals.\n\nJohn's career trajectory reflects his practical approach to life. He worked as a mechanic in a local garage for 25 years before retiring early due to health reasons. His annual retirement income is approximately $42,000, which, combined with his partner's part-time income from a local bakery, allows them to live comfortably. John's partner, Sarah, is 62 and has been instrumental in managing their finances, ensuring they live within their means.\n\nTheir household is relatively simple, with no children of their own but a strong sense of community. They are active in local events and volunteer at a nearby animal shelter. John's primary economic concerns revolve around healthcare costs and the rising prices of living in Wyoming, which he fears might outpace their fixed income. Despite these concerns, John is optimistic about the future and values the freedom and tranquility his life in Wyoming provides.\n\nJohn speaks English fluently and only, having never learned another language. He is proud of his US citizenship and the values it represents, often participating in local political discussions and elections. John's political views are moderate, leaning towards conservative on fiscal issues but liberal on social matters, reflecting his practical upbringing and community-oriented lifestyle.\n\nIn his free time, John enjoys gardening and woodworking, hobbies that allow him to stay active and creative. His life in Wyoming has been peaceful, and he hopes to continue enjoying the simple pleasures it offers."
