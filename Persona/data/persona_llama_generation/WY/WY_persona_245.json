  "PERSONA": "Meet James, a 49-year-old White male, a US-born citizen, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He resides with his parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood. James never married and has no dependents of his own. As a veteran, he served in the US Army for six years, from 1994 to 2000, which has influenced his perspective on national security and patriotism.\n\nJames graduated from Cheyenne Central High School in 1992. After his military service, he pursued various jobs in the construction sector, eventually finding stability as a heavy equipment operator for a local contractor. He earns $52,000 annually, which is slightly above the median household income in Wyoming.\n\nLiving with his parents has allowed James to save on rent and allocate his income towards paying off his student loan and personal debts. However, he also contributes to the household expenses, covering utility bills and groceries. His parents, both in their early seventies, appreciate his financial support, which has become essential for their combined household income.\n\nAs a high school graduate, James values vocational training and apprenticeships, often advocating for more emphasis on these programs in local schools. His experience in the construction industry has made him keenly aware of the need for infrastructure development and job creation in Wyoming. He closely follows state and national policies related to these issues, which influence his voting decisions.\n\nGiven his veteran status and current occupation, James prioritizes economic growth, national security, and affordable healthcare. He is particularly concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, especially housing costs, which he believes are becoming unaffordable for many residents. James supports policies that promote local economic development, create jobs, and ensure that essential services remain accessible to all."
