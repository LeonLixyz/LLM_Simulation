  "PERSONA": "Sof\u00eda Elena Garc\u00eda, a 68-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, is the primary householder of her household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She lives with her husband, Jos\u00e9, in a cozy, two-bedroom condominium in a suburban neighborhood near the city's downtown area. They moved to Wyoming from New Mexico 15 years ago, seeking a quieter lifestyle after Jos\u00e9 retired from his job as an electrician. Sof\u00eda was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and maintains strong ties to her Mexican heritage, celebrating traditional holidays and cooking authentic dishes.\n\nSof\u00eda and Jos\u00e9 have been married for 43 years, having met in high school in Albuquerque. They do not have children together but have several nieces and nephews whom they spoil regularly. Sof\u00eda is a high school graduate, having attended Albuquerque High School, and later took a few community college courses in early childhood education. She worked as a preschool teacher's assistant for over 20 years before retiring five years ago.\n\nAs a US-born citizen, Sof\u00eda is fluent in English but prefers speaking Spanish at home with her husband. Her English proficiency has been an asset in her interactions with the local community, where she volunteers at a bilingual community center, helping recent immigrants with language classes and job placement.\n\nSof\u00eda's household income is a combination of her husband's pension and her own modest retirement savings, totaling around $55,000 annually. They own their condominium, which they purchased 10 years ago for $220,000, and have a mortgage with a monthly payment of $1,200. Sof\u00eda manages the household finances, ensuring they stay within their means and save for their annual trips to visit family in New Mexico.\n\nGiven her economic situation, Sof\u00eda's primary concerns are healthcare costs and potential changes to social security benefits. As a retiree, she relies on Medicare and is anxious about any policy changes that might affect her access to quality healthcare. She also worries about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing property taxes on their condominium, which might impact their ability to maintain their lifestyle. Sof\u00eda stays informed about local and national politics through Spanish-language news channels and discussions with friends at the community center, where she often engages in lively debates about economic policies and their impact on seniors like herself."
