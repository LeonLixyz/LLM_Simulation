  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 29-year-old White male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, he is married to his wife, Emily, who is 27 years old, and they do not have any children. Ryan is a high school graduate from Cheyenne East High School and has not pursued higher education due to his family's financial situation at the time. He has been married to Emily for four years, and they met while working at a local retail store.\n\nRyan works as a Sales Associate at an outdoor gear store in downtown Cheyenne, earning a yearly income of $43,000. Emily works part-time as a librarian at the local library, earning around $25,000 per year. They rent a two-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood near the city center for $1,100 per month. Ryan and Emily are planning to buy a house in the next two years but are currently saving for a down payment.\n\nRyan's family has lived in Wyoming for generations, and he was born and raised in Cheyenne. His father is a retired mechanic, and his mother works as a part-time nurse. Ryan has a strong sense of community and is involved in local outdoor groups, often participating in hiking and camping trips in the nearby mountains.\n\nGiven his economic situation, Ryan's primary concerns are saving for a down payment on a house, paying off his car loan, and building an emergency fund. He is interested in local economic development and supports policies that promote small businesses and outdoor tourism in Wyoming. Ryan and Emily are also concerned about access to affordable healthcare and education in their community, which influences their views on state and national policies."
