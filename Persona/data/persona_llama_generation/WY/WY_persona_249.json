  "PERSONA": "Meet Margaret \"Meg\" Thompson, a 68-year-old white female residing in the small town of Jackson, Wyoming. Born in Fort Collins, Colorado, Meg moved to Wyoming 20 years ago, drawn by the state's vast natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities. She lives with her partner of 12 years, Tom, in a cozy, two-bedroom house they purchased in 2010 for $320,000 in the town's historic district. The couple has no children together, but Meg has a close relationship with Tom's two adult children from his previous marriage.\n\nMeg is a retired dental hygienist, having worked for 25 years in a local clinic before retiring in 2018. She holds an Associate's degree in Dental Hygiene from Casper College, which she earned in 1985. Her annual retirement income is approximately $45,000, supplemented by Tom's pension from his career as a high school teacher. The couple's combined annual household income is around $75,000.\n\nMeg's primary concerns are healthcare and social security, as she has experienced some age-related health issues and wants to ensure that she and Tom can maintain their quality of life. She is also passionate about environmental conservation, particularly in preserving Wyoming's natural resources and public lands.\n\nAs a homeowner, Meg is keenly aware of local property taxes and their impact on her household budget. She is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Jackson, which she believes is pricing out long-time residents and altering the town's character.\n\nMeg speaks English fluently and has never served in the military. She values her independence and is proud of her self-sufficiency, having built a fulfilling career and life in Wyoming. Her lack of children has allowed her to pursue hobbies like hiking, birdwatching, and painting, which she enjoys in her free time.\n\nMeg's marital status is listed as \"never married,\" but she has been in a committed partnership with Tom for over a decade. This assumption is made based on the provided metadata, which indicates a \"Married-couple Without kids\" household type, but lists her marital status as \"Never married.\" This discrepancy suggests that Meg and Tom may not be formally married but have a long-term, committed relationship.\n\nOverall, Meg Thompson is a practical, environmentally conscious, and independent individual who values her life in Wyoming and is concerned about the economic and social issues affecting her community."
