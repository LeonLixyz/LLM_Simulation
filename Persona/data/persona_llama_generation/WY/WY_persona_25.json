  "PERSONA": "John Michael Davis, a 39-year-old White male, is a primary householder and has been married to his wife, Emily, for eight years. They currently reside in a single-family home in Casper, Wyoming, which they purchased six years ago for $240,000 with a 20% down payment and a 15-year mortgage at a 3.5% interest rate. Their household income is $67,400 per year.\n\nJohn is a non-veteran and was born in Billings, Montana. He holds a master's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Wyoming, which he earned after completing his undergraduate degree in the same field. He is fluent in English and speaks it well.\n\nAs a construction project manager for a local firm specializing in residential development, John works 45 hours a week and earns $64,800 per year. He has been with the company for seven years and has seen steady career growth, with a 10% salary increase in the past two years. He is covered under his employer's private health insurance plan, which also covers his wife.\n\nJohn's wife, Emily, works part-time as a librarian at the local public library, earning around $20,000 per year. Her income is not included in John's reported income range, but it contributes significantly to their household's overall financial stability.\n\nJohn and Emily do not have any children, which allows them to allocate a significant portion of their income toward saving for retirement and paying off their mortgage. They aim to pay off their mortgage within the next nine years and have been diligently saving for a potential down payment on a vacation home in the future.\n\nJohn's economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly housing costs, and the impact of inflation on their savings. He is also worried about the potential downturn in the construction industry, which could affect his job security. Despite these concerns, John feels financially stable and is optimistic about his career prospects and the overall economic growth in Wyoming."
