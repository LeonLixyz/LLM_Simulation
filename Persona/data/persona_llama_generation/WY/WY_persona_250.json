  "PERSONA": "John Michael Davis, a 38-year-old White male, lives with his wife, Emily, in a small suburban house in Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder, John works as an operations coordinator for a local oil drilling company, earning approximately $65,000 per year. He has some college education, having attended Casper College for two years before dropping out to work and support his family. John's job provides him with a stable income, health insurance, and a 401(k) plan, which he contributes to regularly.\n\nJohn and Emily, who works part-time as a librarian, have been married for eight years. They met in college and decided to settle in Casper due to its slower pace of life and outdoor recreational opportunities. They own their home, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house with a small backyard, which they purchased five years ago for $220,000. Their mortgage payment is around $1,400 per month, and they have a car loan for their 2018 Ford F-150.\n\nJohn's parents moved to Wyoming from Illinois when he was a teenager, and he has grown to love the state's wide open spaces and outdoor lifestyle. He enjoys hunting, fishing, and hiking in his free time. John's economic concerns include saving for retirement, paying off their mortgage, and affording potential future college tuition for any children they might have. He is also worried about the impact of fluctuations in the oil industry on his job security and the local economy.\n\nAs a non-veteran and someone who has lived in Wyoming for most of his life, John's views on politics are shaped by his experiences as a working-class individual in a rural state. He values self-reliance, individual freedom, and limited government intervention in the economy. However, he also recognizes the importance of social safety nets and public services, such as education and healthcare, which he believes are essential for the well-being of his community."
