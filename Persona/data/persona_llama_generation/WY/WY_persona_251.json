  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 22-year-old White male, living in the town of Jackson, Wyoming, with his 23-year-old wife, Madison. Ethan is the primary householder and has been married for about two years. He was born in Wyoming and is a US citizen by birth. Ethan speaks English fluently and has no reported proficiency in any other language.\n\nEthan is a high school graduate, having completed his diploma from Jackson Hole High School. After high school, he directly entered the workforce, currently working as a Retail Sales Associate at a local outdoor gear store in Jackson, earning approximately $32,000 per year. His wife, Madison, works part-time as a waitress at a local caf\u00e9, contributing around $18,000 annually to their household income.\n\nThe couple rents a one-bedroom apartment in the town center for $1,200 per month, which is relatively affordable given Jackson's high cost of living. Ethan and Madison prioritize saving for a down payment on a home, aiming to purchase a house within the next five years.\n\nGiven their economic situation, Ethan's primary economic concerns revolve around saving for a home, managing the high cost of living in Jackson, and potentially pursuing further education or training to enhance his career prospects and increase his earning potential. He is particularly interested in political policies that support affordable housing initiatives, education, and local economic development in rural areas like Wyoming.\n\nEthan's marital status and household type influence his views on family-oriented policies, such as healthcare and education. As a young couple without kids, they are focused on building a stable financial foundation before starting a family. This perspective shapes his priorities on economic policies that support young families and first-time homebuyers.\n\nAssumption: Given the null value for ethnicity, it is assumed that Ethan identifies as non-Hispanic White, which is consistent with the majority demographic in Wyoming."
