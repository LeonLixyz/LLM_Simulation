  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Alex resides in a modest, single-family home she owns in a middle-class neighborhood. She is married to her husband, Ryan, a 40-year-old high school sweetheart whom she met while attending high school in her hometown of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Although they are currently married, they are temporarily separated due to Ryan's work as a long-haul truck driver, which keeps him on the road for extended periods.\n\nAlex holds a high school diploma from Cheyenne Central High School and briefly attended Casper College but did not pursue a degree. Instead, she entered the workforce directly, starting as a part-time waitress at a local diner. Over the years, she worked her way up to become a shift manager, earning a stable income of $43,000 per year. Her job provides health insurance and a modest retirement plan, which she contributes to regularly.\n\nAlex's economic concerns revolve around maintaining her home, managing the household budget, and planning for the future. As a homeowner, she is keenly aware of the importance of affordable housing and the challenges of homeownership, particularly in Wyoming's fluctuating energy-based economy. Her primary economic priorities include saving for retirement, paying off her mortgage, and ensuring she has a financial safety net in case of unexpected expenses or job loss.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and camping in the nearby Casper Mountain Recreation Area. She is also an avid reader and participates in a local book club. Alex's social circle consists mainly of close friends from work and acquaintances from her neighborhood. Despite being a non-veteran herself, Alex has a deep respect for the military and often volunteers at local events supporting veterans' organizations.\n\nAlex's views on politics are shaped by her personal experiences as a working-class woman and homeowner in a rural state. She is concerned about issues like affordable healthcare, education, and job security, which she believes are crucial for the well-being of her community. Alex tends to vote for candidates who prioritize these issues and support local economic development initiatives."
