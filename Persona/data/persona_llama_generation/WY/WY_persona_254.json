  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Klaus M\u00fcller, a White male living in the state of Wyoming. Klaus was born in the United States, specifically in the small town of Cody, Wyoming, where he has spent most of his life. He is a high school graduate, having completed his education at Cody High School. Klaus speaks fluent German at home, which is reflected in his \"Other Indo-European languages\" categorization, but he also speaks English well, having used it predominantly in his professional and social interactions throughout his life.\n\nKlaus is currently separated from his wife, with whom he was married for over 30 years. They have two grown children who are now independent and living in other parts of the country. As the \"Spouse of Householder,\" Klaus lives with his wife in a shared household, despite their separation, primarily for economic reasons and to maintain a sense of family unity for their children who occasionally visit.\n\nKlaus works as a part-time handyman and repair services provider, leveraging the skills he acquired during his years working in the construction industry. His income is approximately $35,000 per year, which, combined with his wife's income as a part-time librarian, allows them to afford their modest, mortgaged home in a suburban neighborhood of Cody. They have been struggling to pay off their mortgage and are concerned about their financial security, especially with Klaus's income being irregular.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Klaus does not receive any veteran benefits, and his primary economic concerns are healthcare costs, given his age, and the sustainability of his part-time work. He is worried about the impact of potential economic downturns on his ability to continue working and supporting himself and his wife, even if they are separated.\n\nKlaus's educational background as a high school graduate has limited his career advancement opportunities, but he takes pride in his practical skills and his ability to contribute to the local community through his handyman services. Living in Wyoming, Klaus is also keenly aware of the state's economic reliance on industries such as coal mining and tourism, which influences his views on environmental policies and job creation initiatives.\n\nGiven his situation, Klaus's economic priorities include affordable healthcare, job security for older workers, and policies that support small businesses and local economies. His political views are shaped by his experiences as a small business owner, a separated spouse living in a shared household, and a resident of a state heavily impacted by federal policies on natural resources and healthcare."
