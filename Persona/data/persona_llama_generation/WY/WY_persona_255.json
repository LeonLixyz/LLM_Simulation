  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old white female who identifies as a US citizen, born in Montana but currently residing in Wyoming. Due to her current homeless status, Alex frequently moves between temporary accommodations in the city of Cheyenne, often staying in shelters or short-term housing facilities.\n\nAs a veteran, Alex served in the US Army for three years before being honorably discharged at the age of 19. Her military background has had a profound impact on her life, contributing to her resilience and resourcefulness. Despite her young age, Alex has experienced significant life challenges, which have shaped her perspectives on economic and social policies.\n\nAlex's educational background consists of completing 11th grade at a public high school in Montana before dropping out due to family circumstances. She has been considering enrolling in a GED program at a local community college in Cheyenne to improve her job prospects.\n\nAs a non-native English speaker, Alex's first language is German, which she learned from her parents who immigrated to the United States from Germany before she was born. She speaks English well but sometimes struggles with complex conversations or formal writing.\n\nAlex's current occupation is a part-time waitress at a local diner in downtown Cheyenne, earning a minimum wage of $5.15 per hour plus tips. Her income is around $1,200 per month, which is barely enough to cover her basic expenses, including food, hygiene products, and occasional nights at a motel when shelters are full.\n\nAs a homeless individual, Alex's primary economic concerns revolve around affordable housing, access to healthcare, and job stability. She is worried about the lack of resources for homeless veterans in Wyoming and the limited availability of affordable housing options. Alex is eager to secure a better-paying job, possibly in administration or customer service, utilizing the skills she acquired during her military service.\n\nAlex's family structure is complex, with her parents having passed away when she was a teenager. She has a younger brother who is currently living with an aunt in Montana. Alex's experience with homelessness has made her empathetic toward others facing similar challenges and has motivated her to advocate for policies addressing housing affordability, education, and veteran support."
