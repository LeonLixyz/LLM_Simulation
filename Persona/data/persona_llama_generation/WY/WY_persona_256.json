  "PERSONA": "The individual is a 29-year-old White male, born in the United States but in a different state from his current residence, Wyoming. Given his birth in a different state, it is assumed he moved to Wyoming for work or family reasons. As the primary householder of a married-couple household with kids, he is married to his 27-year-old wife, who works part-time. They have two children, ages 4 and 6, both of whom attend local public schools in their neighborhood.\n\nThis individual is a high school graduate with a general education diploma, having completed his education in his home state before moving to Wyoming. After high school, he pursued vocational training in automotive repair and works as an automotive technician at a local car dealership in Cheyenne, the capital city of Wyoming. His annual income is approximately $52,000, which, combined with his wife's part-time income as a dental hygienist ($30,000 per year), provides a household income of $82,000.\n\nThe family resides in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they purchased for $280,000 with a 20% down payment. Their monthly mortgage payment is $1,300, which includes property taxes and insurance. They also have two vehicles: a 2018 Honda Civic for his wife's daily commute and a 2020 Ford F-150 for his work and family needs.\n\nThis individual's economic concerns include saving for his children's education, paying off their mortgage, and ensuring job security in the automotive sector, which he perceives as being vulnerable to economic downturns and technological changes. His political views are likely influenced by his desire for economic stability, support for local businesses, and access to quality public education for his children."
