  "PERSONA": "A 68-year-old, married, white female living in the state of Wyoming. She resides with her parents in a multigenerational household in the city of Casper, Wyoming, due to health reasons that have required her to care for them full-time. This living arrangement is a result of her parents' declining health and her desire to support them.\n\nShe has been married to her high school sweetheart, a 70-year-old retired oil rig worker, for 45 years. Her husband's pension and their combined Social Security benefits provide a stable income of $55,000 annually, allowing them to live comfortably. However, they have significant expenses related to her parents' medical care, which has forced them to be cautious with their spending.\n\nThe individual has some college education, having attended Casper College for two years before dropping out to care for her ailing mother. She never pursued a degree but has worked in various administrative roles throughout her life, most recently as a part-time receptionist at a local doctor's office until her parents required her full-time care.\n\nHer primary concern is the rising cost of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on her family's ability to afford medical care for her parents. She is also worried about the local economy, as the decline of the coal industry has affected many of her friends and neighbors, making her anxious about the future of Casper's job market."
