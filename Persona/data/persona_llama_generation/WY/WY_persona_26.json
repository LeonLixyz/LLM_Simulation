  "PERSONA": "A 49-year-old white female, born in Montana but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in a cohabiting couple household with her partner, Alex, a 47-year-old freelance writer. She is divorced from her previous husband due to irreconcilable differences and does not have any children. As the primary householder, she takes care of the majority of household expenses and financial decisions. \n\nShe holds an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education from the local community college in Cheyenne, which she obtained after moving to Wyoming 10 years ago. Her educational background and passion for childcare led her to a fulfilling career as a preschool teacher at a local public elementary school, where she has been employed for the past 8 years. Her annual income is $42,000, and her partner contributes an additional $30,000 through his freelance work, totaling a combined household income of $72,000.\n\nAs a preschool teacher, she is covered by the school's public insurance plan, which provides her with comprehensive health coverage. Her job is stable, but she often expresses concerns about the limited resources available for early childhood education and the impact of budget cuts on her students' learning experience.\n\nShe and her partner rent a cozy two-bedroom apartment in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne, paying $900 per month. They enjoy the outdoors and often spend their free time hiking in the nearby mountains or exploring the local art scene. Her economic priorities include saving for retirement, paying off her student loans, and advocating for better funding for public education in Wyoming."
