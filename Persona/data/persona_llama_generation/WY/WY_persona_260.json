  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Carlos Morales, a retired high school janitor who lives with his wife, Maria, in a modest, single-story home on the outskirts of Casper, Wyoming. Carlos is of Maya descent, with his ancestors originally from Guatemala, but he was born in the United States. His family has maintained strong ties to their American Indian and Alaska Native heritage through cultural practices and community involvement.\n\nCarlos graduated from Natrona County High School and never pursued higher education due to financial constraints and family obligations. After working various jobs, he found stable employment as a janitor at his alma mater, where he worked for 25 years before retiring at 62.\n\nCarlos and Maria, who works part-time as a librarian, have been married for 45 years and have two grown children, both of whom have moved out of state for college and career opportunities. Their household income is approximately $45,000 per year, primarily from Carlos's pension and Maria's part-time job.\n\nCarlos's primary economic concerns include managing their retirement savings, affording healthcare, and ensuring they can maintain their home, which they own outright. He is particularly interested in policies related to Social Security, Medicare, and affordable housing for seniors. He also values education and is supportive of local initiatives that promote cultural diversity and understanding.\n\nCarlos speaks English fluently and has never served in the military. He spends his free time volunteering at a local community center that serves the American Indian community, where he teaches traditional crafts and helps with cultural events. Carlos and Maria are proud of their heritage and strive to pass it down to their grandchildren through stories, traditional foods, and cultural practices."
