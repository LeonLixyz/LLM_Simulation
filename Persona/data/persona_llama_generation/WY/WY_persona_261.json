  "PERSONA": "Meet Harold Thompson, a 69-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with his wife in a household he does not head. Born in Billings, Montana, Harold moved to Wyoming in his late 20s for work. He has been married to his high school sweetheart, Carol, for 47 years. Harold's educational background includes completing 11th grade but not obtaining a high school diploma. \n\nHarold worked as a mechanic for a local trucking company for over 30 years before retiring at 62. His annual retirement income is approximately $45,000 from a combination of Social Security and a small pension from his former employer. Carol, who is 67, works part-time as a librarian, earning around $18,000 per year. Their combined income is $63,000.\n\nThe Thompsons own their home, a modest three-bedroom house in a middle-class neighborhood in Cheyenne, which they purchased in 1985 for $120,000. The house is now valued at around $250,000. They have two adult children, both of whom have moved out of state for work, and four grandchildren. Harold and Carol are proud of their children's accomplishments but sometimes feel the distance acutely.\n\nHarold's primary economic concerns include the rising cost of healthcare and the impact of inflation on their fixed income. He is also worried about the future of Social Security and the potential for changes that could affect his benefits. Harold is a self-described conservative and votes accordingly, prioritizing issues related to economic stability, low taxes, and national security. Despite his conservative leanings, he is open to listening to differing viewpoints and values education and critical thinking."
