  "PERSONA": "Deborah Thompson, a 62-year-old White female, born in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming, where she currently resides. Deborah is a high school graduate and speaks English fluently, having never spoken any other language at home. She is a widow, having lost her spouse about 5 years ago after 35 years of marriage. Deborah was the primary householder of her household, but due to her spouse's passing, she now lives alone in a single-family home in a rural area near the town of Cody, Wyoming, which they had purchased together in 2001 for $170,000. She has a mortgage with a monthly payment of $800. Deborah works part-time as a librarian at the local library, earning approximately $30,000 per year. Deborah does not have any children. Deborah is a non-veteran and has never served in the military. Deborah's primary economic concerns include managing her mortgage payments, maintaining her health insurance, and saving for retirement, as her spouse's pension does not fully cover her living expenses. Deborah's experience as a widow has led her to prioritize economic policies that support seniors, particularly those related to affordable healthcare and housing."
