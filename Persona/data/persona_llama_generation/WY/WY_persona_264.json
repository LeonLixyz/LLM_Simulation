  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 62-year-old white female, is the primary householder of a married-couple household without children. She resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital, with her husband, John, in a modest single-family home they've owned for over a decade. Emily is a US-born citizen, originally from Nebraska, and has been a resident of Wyoming for the past 20 years. She is a high school graduate and has maintained strong English proficiency, speaking it as her primary language.\n\nEmily has been married to John, a 65-year-old retired mechanic, for 35 years. They do not have any children, which has allowed them to focus on their careers and personal interests. Emily worked as an administrative assistant for a local insurance company for over 20 years before retiring at 58. Her annual retirement income is approximately $40,000, supplemented by John's pension and their combined social security benefits.\n\nEmily's household income is around $65,000, placing them in a relatively comfortable financial situation. They own their home, which they purchased for $180,000 in 2008, and have managed to pay off a significant portion of their mortgage. Emily's primary economic concerns are the rising costs of healthcare and maintaining their retirement savings, which they have been diligently building over the years.\n\nEmily is active in her community, volunteering at a local animal shelter and participating in neighborhood events. She values her independence and enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and gardening. Emily's educational background and life experiences have instilled in her a strong sense of self-reliance and a desire for fiscal responsibility, which influences her views on economic policies and government spending.\n\nGiven her demographic characteristics, Emily is likely to prioritize issues related to retirement security, affordable healthcare, and local community development. Her experiences as a retiree and homeowner in a relatively conservative state like Wyoming may also shape her views on taxation, government regulation, and social welfare programs."
