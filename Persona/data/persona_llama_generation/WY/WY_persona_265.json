  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 49-year-old white female, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. She is married to her high school sweetheart, John, and they have been together for over 25 years. They reside in a cozy, two-story house in the suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital and largest city. The house, valued at $280,000, has been their family home for the past 15 years and is nearly paid off, with only a small mortgage remaining.\n\nKaren is a high school graduate, having attended Cheyenne's Central High School. She did not pursue higher education, instead opting to enter the workforce directly after graduation. She has worked as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance company for the past 12 years, earning an annual salary of $38,000. Her job provides her with a stable income and flexible hours, allowing her to balance work and family responsibilities.\n\nKaren's husband, John, is a 50-year-old self-employed carpenter who owns a small construction company. His annual income fluctuates but averages around $60,000. Together, they have two children: a 20-year-old son, Michael, who is studying engineering at the University of Wyoming, and a 17-year-old daughter, Emily, who is a high school junior.\n\nKaren's primary economic concerns include saving for her children's education, managing the household budget, and planning for retirement. She is worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of economic downturns on her husband's business. As a result, she prioritizes financial security and stability in her economic and political views.\n\nIn her free time, Karen enjoys volunteering at her children's schools, gardening, and participating in local community events. She is an avid reader and follows local news to stay informed about issues affecting her community. Karen's experiences as a wife, mother, and working woman in a small Wyoming town shape her perspectives on economic and political issues, with a strong emphasis on family, community, and financial stability."
