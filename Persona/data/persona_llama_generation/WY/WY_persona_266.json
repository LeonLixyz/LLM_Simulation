He holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he completed two years ago. Ethan is fluent in English, having spoken it as his primary language since birth.\n\nEthan works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm in Cheyenne, earning an annual salary of $62,000. His job involves assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of various development projects in Wyoming. Although he is married, he and his wife, Sarah, have decided to live with his parents temporarily to save money and pay off student loans. Ethan's wife works part-time as a teacher at a local elementary school, contributing $25,000 to their combined household income.\n\nThe Thompson family resides in a spacious, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne. The house is owned by Ethan's parents, who are both retired and live off their pensions and social security benefits. Ethan and his wife are responsible for paying a monthly rent of $800, which helps with the household expenses.\n\nEthan's educational background has significantly influenced his career trajectory. His graduate degree has enabled him to secure a well-paying job in his field of interest. However, the high cost of education has left him with substantial student loans, which he is currently paying off. This financial burden is a significant concern for Ethan, and he is keenly interested in economic policies that address student loan debt and affordable education.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ethan is also concerned about the state's economy, which is heavily reliant on the energy industry. He is interested in policies that promote sustainable development and diversification of the state's economy. Ethan's experience living with his parents has also made him aware of the challenges faced by retirees and the importance of social security and pension plans.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, Ethan is focused on saving money, paying off his student loans, and eventually becoming a homeowner. He is also interested in investing in a retirement plan to secure his financial future. Ethan's political views are shaped by his concerns about the environment, education, and economic sustainability. He is likely to support policies that address these issues and promote the well-being of his community."
