  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Ryan Thompson, a white male living in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming. He resides with his parents in a single-family home on the outskirts of town, where they own a small plot of land. Ryan is married to his wife, Emily, whom he met while serving in the US Army. They do not have any children yet, but are considering starting a family soon. \n\nRyan is a veteran who served for six years, including two tours in Afghanistan. After being honorably discharged, he moved back to his hometown of Cody, where his family has lived for generations. His military experience and training led him to secure a job as a heavy equipment operator in the local mining industry, which pays him $55,000 per year. He works a standard 40-hour week, with some overtime opportunities during peak seasons.\n\nRyan attended Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming, for two years, studying diesel mechanics before dropping out to join the military. Although he does not have a college degree, his technical training and experience have been valuable in his current job. He is proud of his work and feels it contributes to the local economy.\n\nRyan and his wife, Emily, who works part-time as a nurse at the local hospital, are planning to buy their own home in the near future. They are currently saving for a down payment and exploring options for a mortgage. Ryan's economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Cody, particularly housing prices, and the impact of fluctuations in the mining industry on his job security. He is also interested in policies supporting veterans' education and employment opportunities.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ryan values the state's wide open spaces and outdoor recreational opportunities. He enjoys hunting and fishing in his free time and is concerned about environmental policies affecting these activities. Ryan's political views are influenced by his military background, his experience working in a traditionally male-dominated industry, and his desire to protect Wyoming's natural beauty for future generations."
