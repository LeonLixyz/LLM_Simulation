  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 62-year-old White female living in the small town of Cody, Wyoming. She has never been married and resides with her younger sister, who is the household head, in a cozy two-bedroom home they own jointly. The sisters share household responsibilities, with Karen handling the cooking and her sister managing the gardening and maintenance tasks. Their home, valued at approximately $280,000, is a significant asset for both of them, especially considering they have no outstanding mortgage.\n\nKaren is a high school graduate from Cody High School and has always been diligent about furthering her education through workshops and training programs, particularly in the administrative support field. She works as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company, earning $64,500 annually. Her job provides her with private health insurance coverage, which is essential given her age and the rising healthcare costs.\n\nKaren is a lifelong resident of Wyoming, born and raised in Cody. She values her community and is involved in local events, often volunteering at the annual Cody Stampede Rodeo. Her income and homeownership status place her in a relatively stable financial situation, but she is concerned about saving for retirement and ensuring she can maintain her lifestyle without becoming a financial burden on her sister.\n\nGiven her age and occupation, Karen's economic concerns revolve around retirement security, affordable healthcare, and the potential for Social Security adjustments. She is also keenly aware of the importance of local economic development, as it affects her community's vitality and her own job security. Politically, she tends to support policies that promote small businesses, improve access to affordable healthcare, and protect Social Security benefits for future generations."
