  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson is a 57-year-old white female, born in Oregon, USA, but currently residing in a rural town in Wyoming with her husband, Jack, and her 19-year-old son, Ethan, who is attending a local community college. Although she is married, her husband lives and works in a different state due to job requirements, and they maintain a long-distance relationship. They own a modest, single-family home in Wyoming, which they've had for over a decade.\n\nAlex's household is a multigenerational one, as she also lives with her 75-year-old mother, who moved in after her father's passing. Alex's mother has some health issues, so Alex takes on a caregiving role, managing her mother's appointments and daily needs.\n\nAlex's educational background includes two years of study at a local community college in Oregon, where she majored in business administration. However, she didn't complete her degree due to family obligations. She has been working part-time as a bookkeeper at a small, family-owned business in Wyoming for the past eight years. Her annual income is around $35,000.\n\nAs a non-native resident of Wyoming, Alex has developed a strong appreciation for the local culture and has become involved in her community. She volunteers at a local animal shelter and participates in town hall meetings, where she often speaks up on issues related to education and healthcare.\n\nAlex's primary concerns are related to her son's education and her mother's healthcare. She is worried about Ethan's student loan debt and the rising costs of higher education. She is also concerned about the lack of healthcare facilities and specialized care services in her rural area, which affects her mother's well-being.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, Alex values job security, affordable healthcare, and access to quality education. She believes in supporting local businesses and is concerned about the impact of large corporations on small towns like hers. As someone who has experienced the challenges of a long-distance relationship, she also advocates for policies that support working families and caregivers."
