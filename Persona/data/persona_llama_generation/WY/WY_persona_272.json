  "PERSONA": "Ronald \"Ron\" Thompson, a 68-year-old white male, resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital. Born in Fort Collins, Colorado, Ron moved to Wyoming with his family at the age of 12 when his father, a retired mechanic, decided to relocate for a quieter life. He currently lives with his 92-year-old mother, who owns the single-family home they share in a modest suburban neighborhood. His father passed away 10 years ago.\n\nRon's educational background consists of completing two years at Laramie County Community College, where he studied automotive repair, but he did not graduate due to personal reasons. He has been working as a car mechanic at a local repair shop for over 25 years, earning $52,000 annually. Despite never being married, Ron is close to his nieces and nephews, who live in other parts of the country, and values family above all else.\n\nRon's living situation is comfortable, with his mother covering the mortgage, property taxes, and insurance on their home, which is valued at $280,000. His economic concerns revolve around ensuring his mother's financial security and his own retirement, as his current job does not offer a pension plan. He has managed to save $150,000 in a 401(k) and is considering downsizing to a smaller, more affordable living arrangement in the future.\n\nRon's daily life is relatively quiet, with most evenings spent watching local news, reading about history, or working on his old truck in the garage. He is fluent in English, having spoken it his entire life, and has never served in the military. His priorities include accessing quality, affordable healthcare and ensuring the economic stability of his community, which he believes is threatened by the decline of traditional industries such as coal mining in Wyoming."
