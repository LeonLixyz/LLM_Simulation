  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Wyatt Thompson, a retired financial analyst who lives with his 92-year-old mother in a cozy, two-bedroom house in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. Wyatt's mixed heritage - his mother is of White descent, and his late father was an enrolled member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe - has instilled in him a deep appreciation for his Native American roots and the vast, open spaces of the American West.\n\nWyatt holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he earned in 1977. After college, he worked for 30 years as a financial analyst for a regional bank, eventually retiring in 2010. Throughout his career, Wyatt's job required him to live in various towns across Wyoming, but he always maintained a strong connection to his hometown of Lander.\n\nWyatt is married to his wife, Karen, 66, a retired elementary school teacher. They met in college and were married in 1979. Although they do not have any children of their own, Wyatt has been his mother's primary caregiver since his father's passing in 2005. His mother, a widow, still owns the family home, which Wyatt helps maintain. Wyatt's household income consists of his retirement pension ($55,000 per year) and Karen's teacher pension ($48,000 per year).\n\nAs a resident of Lander, Wyatt is concerned about the economic implications of Wyoming's declining coal industry on his community. He worries about the potential loss of jobs and the strain on local businesses. Wyatt is also interested in policies that support small businesses, promote tourism, and preserve Wyoming's natural beauty. He is a registered Republican but has become increasingly disillusioned with the party's stance on environmental issues. Wyatt values his independence and is likely to vote for candidates who prioritize local economic development and conservation."
