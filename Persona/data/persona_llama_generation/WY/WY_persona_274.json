  "PERSONA": "Meet Elena M. Garcia, a 68-year-old widow who resides in a cozy, single-family home in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. Born and raised in the United States, Elena holds a Bachelor's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained in 1978. \n\nElena's late husband, Juan, was the primary breadwinner of the family, working as a geologist for a local mining company. As the spouse of the household, Elena managed the household finances, took care of their two children, and worked part-time as a librarian at the local elementary school. After her husband's passing five years ago, Elena continued to live in their family home, which they had purchased in 1985 for $120,000. The house is now valued at approximately $280,000.\n\nAs a widow, Elena's primary source of income is her husband's pension, amounting to $45,000 annually, supplemented by her part-time job at the library, which brings in an additional $18,000 per year. Her total annual income is $63,000. She also receives $24,000 per year from Social Security benefits. Elena's economic concerns revolve around managing her household expenses, which include a $1,200 monthly mortgage payment, $800 for utilities, and $500 for groceries.\n\nElena's educational background has had a significant impact on her career trajectory. She initially worked as a teacher but later transitioned to being a librarian, which allowed her to balance her work and family responsibilities more effectively. Her experience in education has also made her a strong advocate for improving the local school system and increasing funding for education.\n\nElena's family structure consists of two grown children, both of whom have moved out of the state for work. Her son, Michael, is an engineer in Denver, Colorado, and her daughter, Sophia, is a lawyer in Seattle, Washington. Elena is proud of her children's accomplishments but wishes they lived closer to home. She is actively involved in her community, volunteering at the local library and participating in town hall meetings to voice her opinions on issues affecting the community.\n\nGiven her age and economic situation, Elena's primary economic concerns include managing her retirement savings, ensuring she can afford healthcare, and maintaining her standard of living. She is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing cost of healthcare and housing. Elena's political views are centered around issues affecting seniors, education, and the local economy. She is likely to support policies that promote affordable healthcare, increase funding for education, and stimulate local economic growth."
