  "PERSONA": "John, a 68-year-old White male, resides in a small suburban town near Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Wyoming, John has spent his entire life in the state, with a strong connection to the local community. He lives with his 94-year-old father in the family home, a single-story ranch-style house they own in a quiet neighborhood. John's mother passed away five years ago, and he has taken on the primary caregiving responsibilities for his father. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Barbara, 66, who works part-time as a librarian at the local library. They have two children, both grown and moved out, with three grandchildren who live in nearby towns. John's marital status is \"now married, except separated\" due to a brief period of separation 10 years ago, but they reconciled after counseling.\n\nJohn attended Cheyenne's Laramie County Community College, studying business administration for two years before dropping out to work full-time at his family's small hardware store. He eventually took over the store from his father and ran it successfully for 25 years before selling it to a larger chain when he was 60. John currently works part-time as a sales associate at the same hardware store, earning $35,000 per year. Barbara's part-time income is $20,000 per year. They have a combined annual household income of $55,000.\n\nJohn's primary economic concerns are ensuring his father's care is covered, saving for his own retirement, and maintaining their current standard of living. He is keenly aware of the rising costs of healthcare and housing in Wyoming, which affects his decisions on how to allocate their income. As a lifelong resident of Wyoming, John is deeply invested in local politics and is particularly interested in policies that support small businesses, veterans (despite being a non-veteran himself, he has many friends who are), and senior care. He votes in local and national elections, prioritizing candidates who understand the needs of rural communities and seniors."
