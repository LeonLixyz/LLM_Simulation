  "PERSONA": "The individual is a 22-year-old white male, born in the state of New York but currently residing in Wyoming. He is married to the household's primary earner, indicating a non-traditional household structure for someone of his age. Given his marital status as \"Never married\" is inconsistent with the household relationship as \"Spouse of Householder,\" it is assumed that this is an error and he is indeed married but possibly in a domestic partnership or common-law marriage.\n\nHe holds a graduate degree from the University of Wyoming in Laramie, where he studied environmental engineering. This educational background positions him in a career trajectory within the energy or environmental sectors, possibly working for the state or federal government, given Wyoming's strong presence of these industries. His job title is an Environmental Consultant, with a specific focus on sustainable practices in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe and his partner rent a house in a suburban area of Cheyenne, the capital city of Wyoming. Their rent is around $1,200 per month for a two-bedroom house, which is relatively affordable in the area. His annual income is approximately $65,000, a decent starting salary for someone in his field and educational background.\n\nAs a recent graduate and young professional, his economic concerns include paying off student loans, which total around $30,000. He also hopes to save for a down payment on a house, as he and his partner are interested in becoming homeowners in the near future. His partner's income is significantly higher, working as a software engineer for a major tech firm with operations in Cheyenne, earning around $110,000 annually.\n\nGiven his educational background and career focus, he is likely concerned about environmental policies, sustainable energy practices, and the economic balance between environmental protection and industrial growth, particularly in a state heavily reliant on the fossil fuel industry. His economic priorities include affordable housing, student loan forgiveness programs, and policies supporting sustainable energy development."
