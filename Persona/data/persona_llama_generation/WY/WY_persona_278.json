  "PERSONA": "Emily Thompson, a 62-year-old White female, is the primary householder of her single-person household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Denver, Colorado, she has been a US citizen by birth and has lived in Wyoming for over two decades. Emily holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which has significantly contributed to her career as an Environmental Consultant specializing in sustainable practices for local businesses.\n\nEmily is married but currently separated from her husband, who works in the oil industry and spends most of his time in other states. They own a modest, single-story home in a suburban area of Cheyenne, which Emily has been maintaining on her own. Her annual household income is around $85,000, primarily from her consulting work and some investments she made in renewable energy projects.\n\nGiven her educational background and professional experience, Emily is particularly concerned about environmental policies and their implications on Wyoming's economy. She supports sustainable practices and believes in the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection. Her economic priorities include investing in renewable energy sources, promoting eco-friendly businesses, and ensuring that environmental regulations do not overly burden local industries.\n\nEmily's living situation and marital status have led her to be financially independent and cautious in her economic decisions. She values stability and security, which influences her views on economic policies, particularly those related to taxation, healthcare, and social security. Her experience as a homeowner and her involvement in the local community also make her interested in policies affecting housing, education, and community development.\n\nAs a well-educated and environmentally conscious individual, Emily is likely to engage in local politics and advocate for policies that align with her values. Her specific concerns and priorities are shaped by her professional expertise, personal experiences, and the economic realities of living in Wyoming."
