  "PERSONA": "Meet 49-year-old Ryan Thompson, a US-born citizen living in Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Ryan resides in a modest, rented two-bedroom apartment in a middle-class neighborhood, with a monthly rent of $850. He has been married for over a decade to his wife, Rachel, but they are currently separated due to irreconcilable differences. Despite this, they remain on amicable terms, and Rachel lives in a nearby apartment.\n\nRyan's educational background consists of a high school diploma from Natrona County High School, which he obtained in 1994. After high school, he pursued a series of entry-level jobs in the retail sector, eventually landing a stable position as a sales associate at a local outdoor gear store. Over the years, he has worked his way up to become the store's assistant manager, earning an annual salary of $43,000.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Ryan does not have any military experience. His language proficiency is limited to English, which he speaks fluently. He has never had the opportunity to pursue higher education beyond high school but values the importance of education and hopes to one day return to school to study business administration.\n\nRyan's economic concerns are centered around financial stability and security. As a single male without kids, he is focused on rebuilding his life after the separation and ensuring he can provide for himself and potentially his future family. He is keenly aware of the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly the increasing housing costs, and worries about his ability to afford a home in the future. Ryan's economic priorities include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off his outstanding credit card debt of $5,000, and building an emergency fund to cover three to six months of living expenses.\n\nGiven his situation, Ryan is likely to be interested in economic policies that address affordable housing, job security, and access to affordable education. He may also be concerned about healthcare costs and the impact of economic policies on small businesses, as his store often struggles to compete with larger retail chains."
