  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Maria Hernandez, a 49-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States in the state of Wyoming. She is the primary householder of a married-couple household with kids, residing in the town of Casper, Wyoming, in a modest, single-family home that she and her husband, Carlos, have owned for over a decade. Ana Maria is a US citizen and has been married to Carlos, a construction worker, for 22 years. They have two children: a 17-year-old son, Juan, who is a high school student, and a 13-year-old daughter, Sofia, who is in middle school.\n\nAna Maria is a veteran who served in the US Army for four years after high school, where she was a supply specialist. After her service, she leveraged the skills she gained to secure a job as a logistics coordinator at a local manufacturing company, where she has worked for over 15 years. She is fluent in Spanish and speaks English well, which has been beneficial in her professional and personal life.\n\nAna Maria's educational background includes a high school diploma from Natrona County High School in Casper. Although she did not pursue higher education, her experience in the military and her job have provided her with valuable skills and training. Her income is approximately $55,000 per year, and her husband's income from construction work adds another $40,000, making their combined household income around $95,000 annually.\n\nAna Maria's economic concerns include saving for her children's college education, managing the mortgage on their home, and ensuring they have a secure financial future. She is also concerned about access to affordable healthcare, especially for veterans like herself. Given her military background and current job in logistics, Ana Maria values efficiency and organization, which influences her views on economic policies, particularly those related to job creation, education, and veterans' benefits."
