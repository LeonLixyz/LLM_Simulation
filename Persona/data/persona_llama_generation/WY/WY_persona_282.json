  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 57-year-old White female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder of her single-person household, Karen resides in a modest, two-bedroom apartment in the historic downtown area, which she rents for $900 per month. She has been married for over 20 years but is currently separated from her husband, who lives in a different part of the state due to work commitments.\n\nKaren was born in Colorado but has called Wyoming home for the past 15 years. She holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Laramie County Community College, which has served her well in her career as an administrative assistant at a local insurance firm. Her annual income is $42,000, and she works 35 hours a week, often taking on extra hours during peak seasons to supplement her income.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Karen does not have any direct military experience, but her brother served in the Army, and she is proud of his service. She speaks only English, which she speaks very well, and has never had to rely on a second language in her personal or professional life.\n\nKaren's economic concerns are centered around saving for retirement, as she hopes to retire within the next 8-10 years. She is also keenly aware of the rising cost of living in Cheyenne and worries about the impact of inflation on her fixed income. Despite these concerns, Karen values her independence and is proud of her ability to manage her finances and maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nPolitically, Karen tends to lean conservative, particularly on issues related to small business and economic development. She believes in limited government intervention and lower taxes, which she thinks would help stimulate local economic growth and create more job opportunities for Wyoming residents. However, she also values social programs that support education and healthcare, reflecting her more moderate stance on social issues.\n\nOverall, Karen Thompson is a practical, no-nonsense individual who values hard work, financial responsibility, and community involvement. Her experiences as a single female household head in a relatively conservative state have shaped her economic and political views, making her a unique and informed participant in local discussions around policy and governance."
