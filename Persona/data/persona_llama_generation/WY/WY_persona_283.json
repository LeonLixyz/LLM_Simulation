  "PERSONA": "Meet 62-year-old Ethan Thompson, a white male who resides in the picturesque town of Jackson, Wyoming, as the primary householder in a cohabiting couple household with two children. Born in Oregon, Ethan has been a US citizen since birth and has lived in Wyoming for over two decades. Ethan's partner, Sarah, is 58 years old, and they have been in a committed relationship for over 15 years. Together, they have a 16-year-old daughter, Emma, and a 13-year-old son, Max. Both children are in public school, with Emma in 11th grade and Max in 8th grade.\n\nEthan holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 1995. His educational background has significantly influenced his career trajectory, leading him to work as an Environmental Consultant for a private firm in Jackson. His job involves assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of local development projects, which aligns with his passion for conservation and sustainability. Ethan earns an annual income of $85,000, which allows him to provide a comfortable life for his family.\n\nThe family resides in a modest, two-story house on the outskirts of Jackson, which they purchased in 2005 for $280,000. Their home is valued at around $420,000, with a monthly mortgage payment of $1,800. Ethan and Sarah also own a vacation cabin in the nearby Grand Teton National Park, which they visit frequently.\n\nEthan's economic concerns are centered around the growing costs of living in Jackson, particularly the increasing housing prices and the impact of tourism on the local environment. He is also worried about the rising costs of healthcare and education, which affects his children's future prospects. As a result, Ethan is likely to support policies that promote affordable housing, environmental conservation, and accessible education.\n\nGiven his educational background and career, Ethan is likely to be interested in policies related to environmental protection, conservation, and sustainable development. His experience as a consultant has also made him aware of the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental concerns, which might influence his views on economic policies."
