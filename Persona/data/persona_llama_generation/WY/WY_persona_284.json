  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 29-year-old married woman, living in a suburban area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a white, US-born citizen, and her native language is English, which she speaks fluently.\n\nAlex is a high school graduate who attended a local community college in Wyoming for two years, studying business administration. However, she did not complete her degree due to financial constraints and the desire to enter the workforce sooner. Her educational background has equipped her with basic knowledge of business principles, which she applies in her current role as an administrative assistant at a small, family-owned insurance firm in Cheyenne.\n\nShe is married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan Thompson, 31, who works as an electrician for a local contractor. They met in their junior year and got married four years ago. The couple currently rents a two-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood, with a monthly rent of $900. They are planning to save for a down payment on a house within the next two years.\n\nAs the spouse of the household's primary breadwinner, Alex's income is secondary but crucial in supporting their lifestyle. She earns $38,000 annually, working 35 hours a week. Her job provides health insurance, which covers both her and Ryan. However, they have to pay out-of-pocket for Ryan's occasional medical expenses related to his job.\n\nAlex's primary economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off her student loan debt ($15,000), and building an emergency fund. She is also interested in furthering her education to enhance her career prospects and increase her earning potential. Given her situation, Alex is likely to support policies that promote affordable housing, student loan forgiveness programs, and job training initiatives that could benefit her and her husband."
