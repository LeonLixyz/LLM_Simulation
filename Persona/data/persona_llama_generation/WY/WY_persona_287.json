  "PERSONA": "Meet Jamie Lynn Thompson, a 38-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming. She resides with her parents, Mark and Susan, in a cozy single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood near the North Casper Club Estates. Jamie is married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan Thompson, a 40-year-old oil rig worker, but they currently live with her parents due to financial constraints.\n\nJamie was born and raised in Wyoming and has always been proud of her Western roots. She graduated from Natrona County High School in 2004 and briefly attended Casper College but did not complete her degree due to family obligations.

Her husband, Ryan, brings in the majority of the household income, working as an oil rig worker for around $60,000 per year.\n\nJamie's primary concern is financial stability, as she and her husband struggle to save for a down payment on their own home. They have a 7-year-old son, Ethan, who attends second grade at a local public school. Jamie is eager to provide a better life for her son and hopes to one day own a home with a backyard where Ethan can play safely.\n\nJamie's family is very important to her, and she values the support system they provide. She is grateful for her parents' help in caring for Ethan while she works part-time. However, she also feels a sense of responsibility to contribute to the household income and save for the future.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Jamie is concerned about the state's economy and the impact of the oil industry's fluctuations on local jobs. She is also worried about the quality of education in her area and hopes that the state will invest more in public schools. Jamie's economic priorities include affordable housing, job security, and access to quality education for her son.\n\nJamie's daily life revolves around her family, work, and community. She enjoys attending local events, such as the Casper Ice Arena's hockey games and the annual Casper Balloon Festival.
