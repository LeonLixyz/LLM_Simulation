  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old White female, residing in the town of Jackson, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of a married-couple household without kids, although her marital status is listed as never married, suggesting a domestic partnership or a non-traditional marital arrangement. \n\nAssuming the marital status discrepancy is due to either a common-law marriage or a personal preference for not formalizing the relationship, Alex shares her life with her partner, Jamie, a 40-year-old freelance writer. They met while Alex was working as a waitress in a local caf\u00e9 in Jackson, where Jamie was a regular customer.\n\nBorn in Oregon, Alex moved to Wyoming for college but did not pursue higher education beyond high school. Instead, she developed a passion for the outdoors and took up a job as a park ranger in Grand Teton National Park. After five years of service, she transitioned to a more administrative role as an office manager for a local outdoor gear store, where she currently works. Her annual income is approximately $52,000.\n\nAlex and Jamie rent a cozy, two-bedroom apartment in a relatively affluent neighborhood of Jackson, with a monthly rent of $1,800. They have a combined household income of around $92,000, with Jamie contributing $40,000 from his writing gigs. They do not have any children but are proud owners of two rescue dogs, Max and Luna.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Alex does not have any direct experience with military life, but her partner, Jamie, has a brother who served in the army, which occasionally influences their conversations about national security and veterans' affairs.\n\nGiven her background and current situation, Alex's primary economic concerns revolve around affordable housing, access to quality healthcare, and the preservation of public lands for future generations. As a resident of Wyoming, she is keenly aware of the state's reliance on the energy industry and the delicate balance between economic growth and environmental protection. Her political views tend to lean toward moderate conservatism, with a strong emphasis on individual freedoms and local governance."
