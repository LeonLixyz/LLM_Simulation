This arrangement also allows Curtis to share the financial burden of living expenses.\n\nHOUSEHOLD_TYPE: Assuming Curtis lives with his parents and considering his marital status, a reasonable assumption would be that the household type is a multigenerational household, where Curtis, his parents, and possibly his spouse reside together.\n\nMARITAL_STATUS: Curtis is married to his wife, Karen, who is 59 years old. They have been married for over 20 years and are not separated, but due to various circumstances, including his living situation with his parents, their relationship dynamics are complex.\n\nVETERAN_STATUS: Curtis is a non-veteran, having never served in the military.\n\nLANGUAGE and ENGLISH_PROFICIENCY: Curtis speaks English as his primary language and communicates effectively, having been born and raised in the United States.\n\nEDUCATION: Curtis has less than a 9th-grade education, which has impacted his career trajectory. He attended school until the age of 14, after which he began working to support his family.\n\nBIRTH_PLACE and CITIZENSHIP: Born in the state of Nebraska but currently residing in Wyoming, Curtis is a US citizen by birth.\n\nSTATE_NAME and STATE_ABBR: Curtis resides in Casper, Wyoming (WY), a city with a relatively low cost of living compared to other parts of the country. He has been living there for over 30 years.\n\nEmployment and Income: Curtis works as a maintenance worker for a local school district in Casper, earning around $42,000 per year. His job is relatively stable, but he worries about the impact of budget cuts on his employment.\n\nFamily Structure and Responsibilities: Curtis's wife, Karen, works part-time as a waitress, bringing in an additional $20,000 annually. They do not have any children of their own, but Curtis's living situation with his parents means he has taken on significant caregiving responsibilities. This has led to increased expenses for healthcare and household necessities.\n\nEconomic Concerns: Curtis's primary economic concerns revolve around job security, the cost of healthcare for his aging parents, and the potential for reduced social security benefits. He is also worried about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly with regards to housing and utilities.\n\nGiven his specific situation, Curtis's economic and political views are likely influenced by concerns about healthcare accessibility, job security, and social safety nets, as well as issues related to multigenerational households and caregiving responsibilities."
