  "PERSONA": "Robert \"Bob\" Jenkins, a 68-year-old white male, residing in a suburban area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Karen, and lives with his 67-year-old wife in their primary residence, which they own outright. Their son, who is 40 years old, lives with them due to a job loss and is currently retraining for a career change. Bob's household is a single-family home with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, located in a neighborhood with a mix of older and newer homes. He speaks English fluently and has no proficiency in any other language.\n\nBob has some college education but does not hold a degree. He attended the University of Wyoming for two years, studying business administration before deciding to pursue a career in sales. He worked as a sales representative for a local car dealership for over 25 years before retiring at 62. His annual retirement income is approximately $55,000, which includes a combination of his pension, Social Security benefits, and part-time work as a golf course ranger.\n\nBob is a lifelong resident of Wyoming, born in Cheyenne, and has always been proud of his state's wide open spaces and outdoor recreational opportunities. He is a non-veteran but has always been supportive of the military and veterans' causes. Bob's wife, Karen, is a retired school teacher who now volunteers at a local animal shelter. They have two grandchildren who live in nearby Casper and visit often.\n\nBob's economic concerns include the rising costs of healthcare and the impact of inflation on his fixed income. He is also worried about the potential for changes in Social Security benefits and how that might affect his retirement security. As a result, Bob tends to be fiscally conservative and votes for candidates who prioritize economic stability and responsible government spending."
