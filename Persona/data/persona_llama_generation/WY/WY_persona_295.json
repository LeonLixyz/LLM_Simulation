  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old White male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder of his household, which is a bit of an anomaly given his marital status as divorced. Ryan's marital status is a result of a previous marriage that ended about three years ago, after which he chose to remain in the marital home, a modest single-family residence in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne. The house, valued at approximately $240,000, is mortgaged, with Ryan paying about $1,400 per month.\n\nRyan's educational background is limited to an 8th-grade education, obtained from a public school in his hometown in Oklahoma, where he was born. He moved to Wyoming about 10 years ago, attracted by job opportunities in the construction industry. Ryan works as a carpenter for a local contractor, earning a gross income of about $55,000 per year. His job is physically demanding but offers a decent income and benefits, including health insurance, which is important to him.\n\nDespite his limited formal education, Ryan has acquired various skills through vocational training and on-the-job experience. He is proud of his ability to provide for himself and is particularly skilled in woodworking and furniture making, hobbies he enjoys in his free time.\n\nRyan's language proficiency in English is excellent, and he has no difficulty communicating his needs or expressing his opinions. However, his lack of higher education sometimes makes him feel at a disadvantage, particularly in understanding complex political and economic issues. Nonetheless, he is keenly interested in local politics and often participates in community meetings, especially those related to zoning and development, which can directly affect his neighborhood and livelihood.\n\nRyan's economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and the cost of living in Wyoming, which he feels is rising too quickly. He is also concerned about the environmental impact of new developments in the area and believes in sustainable practices. Despite these concerns, Ryan is optimistic about his future and the future of his community, believing in the importance of hard work and community engagement.\n\nAssumptions made based on the metadata include Ryan's ethnicity being non-Hispanic, given the absence of any information suggesting otherwise, and his specific job and income details, which are consistent with the median income for a carpenter in Wyoming."
