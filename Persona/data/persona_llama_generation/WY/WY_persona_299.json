  "PERSONA": "A 57-year-old, US-born male of mixed ethnicity (assuming a combination of racial backgrounds due to the \"Some Other Race\" category and the absence of a specified ethnicity), who has been married for over 25 years to his high school sweetheart. They have two children, a 22-year-old son who recently graduated from a local community college and is working part-time, and a 19-year-old daughter who is in her second year at the University of Wyoming, studying environmental science.\n\nHe is a primary householder in a married-couple household with kids, residing in a suburban area of Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital city. His family lives in a moderately sized, two-story house that they own, with a mortgage of approximately $1,200 per month. The house is valued around $320,000, reflecting the relatively lower cost of living in Wyoming compared to other parts of the country.\n\nEducated with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, he works as a middle manager in the finance department of a local bank, earning around $65,000 annually. His job requires him to manage a small team and oversee the financial planning of several community projects.\n\nHaving grown up in a different state, he moved to Wyoming for college and decided to stay due to the state's natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities. He speaks English fluently and has no known proficiency in any other language, reflecting his upbringing and education in English-speaking environments.\n\nAs a non-veteran, his political views might be influenced more by his role as a family provider and his involvement in the local community rather than military service. His economic concerns include saving for his children's education, planning for retirement (he has a 401(k) plan through his employer), and managing the household budget to ensure they can maintain their current lifestyle.\n\nHis family's annual income is around $85,000, which includes his wife's part-time income as a librarian at a local elementary school. They consider themselves middle-class and are proud of their ability to provide a stable life for their children. However, they are concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the impact of national economic policies on their local community."
