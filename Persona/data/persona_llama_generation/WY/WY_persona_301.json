  "PERSONA": "Meet Manuel, a 68-year-old Aztec male living in Casper, Wyoming, with his wife. Born in the United States, Manuel identifies as American Indian and Alaska Native and is proud of his heritage. He is a non-veteran, having never served in the military.\n\nManuel's current marital status is \"now married, except separated,\" indicating that he is in a complicated marital situation. He shares a household with his wife, but they are currently separated and living under the same roof. His wife, also Aztec, is 65 years old and works part-time as a retail salesperson.\n\nManuel has some college education but does not hold a degree. He attended Casper College for two years, studying environmental science but did not complete his degree due to financial constraints. This educational background has influenced his career choices, leading him to work as an environmental technician for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. He earns an annual income of $53,000, which is modest but sufficient for his needs.\n\nAs an environmental technician, Manuel is deeply concerned about climate change and its impact on the environment. His work involves monitoring and enforcing regulations related to air and water quality, which has given him a unique perspective on the importance of environmental conservation. He is an advocate for sustainable practices and renewable energy sources, often participating in local initiatives to promote eco-friendly living.\n\nManuel and his wife own their home, a modest three-bedroom house in a mixed neighborhood of Casper, with a mix of single-family homes and apartments. They have lived there for over 20 years and have seen the area undergo significant changes, including gentrification and increased housing costs. Manuel's concerns about affordable housing and the impact of gentrification on the local community are reflected in his economic priorities.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Manuel is keenly aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry. He has mixed feelings about the industry, recognizing its importance to the local economy but also its environmental impact. Manuel's economic concerns are centered around the need for sustainable economic growth, affordable healthcare, and social security benefits that reflect the rising cost of living.\n\nManuel's Aztec heritage plays a significant role in shaping his worldview. He is proud of his cultural roots and actively participates in local Native American cultural events. His experiences as an American Indian and Alaska Native have also influenced his perspective on social justice and equality, making him an advocate for indigenous rights and representation.\n\nAssumptions made based on the metadata include:\n\n- Manuel's wife is also Aztec and works part-time, as the metadata does not provide information about her employment status or ethnicity.\n- Manuel's household type is assumed to be a \"family household\" due to the \"Child living with Parents\" category, which might be an error in the metadata, given Manuel's age. However, this assumption is made to provide a coherent narrative.\n- Manuel's complicated marital situation is assumed to be due to personal reasons, such as health issues or financial stress, rather than a formal separation or divorce."
