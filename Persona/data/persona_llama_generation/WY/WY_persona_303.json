  "PERSONA": "Meet Emilia Rodriguez, a 79-year-old, white, non-Hispanic woman living in a multi-generational household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Emilia resides with her 92-year-old mother, Sofia, in a cozy, three-bedroom house they have owned since 1995, in a quiet suburban neighborhood near the Cheyenne Botanic Gardens. As a US-born citizen, Emilia was raised in New Mexico, where she spent most of her childhood and young adulthood.\n\nEmilia holds a Master's degree in Education from the University of New Mexico, which she completed in 1969. She spent over three decades working as a school counselor in Albuquerque's public school system before retiring in 2005. Her professional background and higher education have provided her with a comfortable retirement income, with a monthly pension of $3,200 and an additional $1,800 from her investments.\n\nAlthough Emilia never married, she is close to her nieces and nephews, who often visit her and her mother. She is fluent in both English and Spanish, having grown up in a bilingual household. Emilia's economic concerns are centered around ensuring her mother's healthcare needs are met, as Sofia suffers from dementia and requires full-time care. Emilia's top economic priorities include affordable healthcare, social security, and support for senior care programs.\n\nIn her free time, Emilia enjoys gardening, volunteering at the local library, and participating in Cheyenne's annual Frontier Days events. Her living situation and family responsibilities significantly influence her economic and political views, with a focus on policies that support seniors, caregivers, and multigenerational households."
