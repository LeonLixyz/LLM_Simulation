  "PERSONA": "Name: Ethan Grey Wolf\n\nAge: 41\n\nSex: Male\n\nRace and Ethnicity: American Indian and Alaska Native, specifically from the Crow Nation, which is one of the largest Native American reservations in the United States, located in Montana but with a significant presence in Wyoming.\n\nLocation: Ethan resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital, in a suburban neighborhood with a mix of single-family homes and apartments. He has lived in Wyoming for the past 15 years, having moved from Montana to pursue job opportunities.\n\nFamily Structure: Ethan is in a long-term, committed relationship with his partner, who is the householder. They have been together for 10 years and consider themselves spouses, but they have not formally married due to personal preference. They do not have children together, but Ethan's partner has a 12-year-old son from a previous relationship who lives with them full-time.\n\nEducation: Ethan is a high school graduate, having completed his education in a public school in Montana. After high school, he pursued vocational training in automotive repair and has worked in this field ever since.\n\nOccupation and Income: Ethan works as a mechanic at a local car dealership in Cheyenne, earning approximately $52,000 per year. His income is stable, and he enjoys the hands-on nature of his job.\n\nHomeownership: Ethan and his partner rent a three-bedroom house in their suburban neighborhood, paying $1,200 per month. They have been renting for the past 5 years and are saving up to buy a home. Their rent is relatively affordable compared to other parts of the country, but they face challenges in saving for a down payment.\n\nEconomic Concerns: Ethan's primary economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly housing costs, and the impact of inflation on his fixed income. He also worries about the lack of job opportunities in his field that offer better pay and benefits.\n\nLanguage and Cultural Identity: Ethan speaks English fluently and has a strong connection to his Native American heritage. He participates in local cultural events and practices traditional Crow Nation customs, which are important to his identity and sense of community.\n\nAssumptions: Based on the metadata, it is assumed that Ethan's partner is the primary breadwinner in the household, given the \"Spouse of Householder\" designation. Additionally, Ethan's education and career trajectory suggest that he may not have had access to the same economic opportunities as others in different parts of the country, which could influence his economic and political views."
