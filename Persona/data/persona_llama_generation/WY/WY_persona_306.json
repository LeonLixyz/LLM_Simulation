  "PERSONA": "Meet 62-year-old Barbara Johnson, a married, white female, and the primary householder of her single-family home in a rural neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Barbara was born in Illinois but has resided in Wyoming for over 20 years. She is a US citizen, born and raised in the country, and speaks English fluently.\n\nBarbara is a veteran, having served four years in the US Army as an administrative specialist before being honorably discharged. Her experience in the military helped shape her strong work ethic and discipline, which she later applied to her civilian career.\n\nAfter her military service, Barbara pursued higher education but did not complete her degree due to family and work commitments. She attended a local community college in Wyoming for two years, studying business administration. This education helped her secure a job as an office manager at a small insurance firm in Cheyenne, where she worked for over 15 years before taking early retirement at 58.\n\nBarbara's current annual income is approximately $45,000, mostly derived from her pension and part-time work as a freelance bookkeeper for local businesses. She is married to her second husband, John, a 65-year-old retired mechanic, whom she met through mutual friends. They do not have any children together, but Barbara has a close relationship with her husband's adult children from his previous marriage.\n\nAs a homeowner, Barbara is proud of her modest, three-bedroom house, which she and her husband purchased in 2005 for $220,000. They have managed to pay off a significant portion of their mortgage and currently have about $80,000 left on their loan.\n\nGiven her financial situation and life experiences, Barbara's primary economic concerns include maintaining a stable retirement income, managing healthcare costs, and ensuring the long-term affordability of her home. She is also interested in local economic development initiatives that could attract more businesses and create jobs in Cheyenne, as she believes this would benefit the community and her property value.\n\nPolitically, Barbara tends to lean conservative, particularly on issues related to national security, veterans' rights, and small business growth. However, she also values access to affordable healthcare and supports policies that protect the environment, reflecting her love for Wyoming's natural beauty and her desire to preserve it for future generations."
