  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson is an 87-year-old widowed woman living in a small town in Wyoming. Born and raised in the state, she has a deep connection to her community and local culture. As a high school graduate, Agnes completed her education at Cody High School in Cody, Wyoming, where she grew up. She met her late husband, John, in her early 20s, and they were married for 55 years until his passing five years ago. They never had children but were actively involved in their community, often volunteering at local charities and participating in town events.\n\nAgnes lives alone in the same house she and her husband purchased in 1965, a modest single-family home in a quiet neighborhood. The house is fully paid off, but she struggles with the increasing property taxes and maintenance costs on her fixed income. Her annual household income is approximately $35,000, consisting of her late husband's pension, Social Security benefits, and occasional income from renting out a small guest house on their property to tourists.\n\nAs the primary householder, Agnes manages the household finances and takes care of the property. Despite her advanced age, she remains relatively healthy and independent, thanks to her active lifestyle and regular exercise. However, she is concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on her Medicare benefits.\n\nAgnes's economic concerns are centered around maintaining her independence, affording healthcare, and ensuring that her home remains a viable option for her as she ages. She is particularly interested in policies that support seniors, such as programs that help with property tax relief, home maintenance assistance, and affordable healthcare options. As a widow living on a fixed income, Agnes is cautious about any policy changes that might affect her financial stability and independence."
