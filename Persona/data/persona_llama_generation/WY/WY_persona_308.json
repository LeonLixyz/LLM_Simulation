  "PERSONA": "Name: Roberto G\u00f3mez\n\nAge: 87 years old\n\nSex: Male\n\nRace and Ethnicity: Hispanic, of Mexican descent\n\nLocation: Roberto resides in Cheyenne, the capital city of Wyoming, in a quiet suburban neighborhood with a mix of single-family homes and small apartment complexes. His house, which he owns, is valued at approximately $280,000, reflecting the relatively low cost of living in Wyoming.\n\nFamily Structure: Roberto is married to his wife, Elena, 85, whom he met through mutual friends after moving to Wyoming in the 1970s. They have been married for 45 years and have no children. Elena is a retired nurse, and her pension, combined with Roberto's retirement benefits, provides them with a comfortable income.\n\nEducation and Career: Roberto is a high school graduate from a public school in his hometown in Wyoming. After completing high school, he worked as a skilled laborer in the construction industry for over 30 years, eventually starting his own small construction business. He successfully ran the business for 20 years before retiring at the age of 65.\n\nEconomic Situation: Roberto's annual household income is approximately $65,000, which includes his Social Security benefits, Elena's pension, and some income from a small investment portfolio. They own their home outright and have no outstanding mortgage. Their monthly expenses are relatively low, with a significant portion allocated to healthcare costs, given their age.\n\nEconomic Concerns: Roberto's primary economic concerns revolve around healthcare costs and ensuring that he and his wife can maintain their standard of living as they age. He is also worried about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly housing costs, and the impact this might have on their ability to stay in their home.\n\nLanguage and Cultural Background: Roberto was born in the United States but is proud of his Mexican heritage. He speaks English fluently and has never had any difficulties communicating in his daily life. He values his cultural background and enjoys celebrating traditional Mexican holidays and cooking traditional meals.\n\nHealth and Mobility: Roberto is in relatively good health for his age, with some mobility issues due to a hip replacement surgery a few years ago. He uses a cane for support and has adapted his daily routine to accommodate his physical limitations. Elena is also in good health, and they both prioritize staying active and engaged in their community.\n\nPolitical Views: Roberto's economic and political views are shaped by his life experiences as a small business owner and his concerns about healthcare costs and accessibility. He values self-reliance and hard work but also believes in the importance of social safety nets, particularly for seniors and vulnerable populations. He is likely to support policies that address these concerns and promote economic growth in his community."
