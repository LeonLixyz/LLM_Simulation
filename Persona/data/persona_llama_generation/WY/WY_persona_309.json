  "PERSONA": "Tyler James, a 29-year-old White male, lives in Casper, Wyoming, with his wife and her family. Born in Billings, Montana, Tyler moved to Wyoming after high school to be closer to his wife's family and to explore job opportunities. As a high school graduate, he completed a vocational training program in diesel mechanics and is currently employed as a mechanic at a local trucking company, earning $55,000 per year.\n\nTyler is a veteran, having served in the US Army for four years, which included a tour in Afghanistan. His military experience provided him with valuable skills and discipline, but also left him with a service-connected disability that sometimes affects his work. He is proud of his service and feels it has given him a unique perspective on life.\n\nTyler is married to his high school sweetheart, Sarah, who is originally from Casper. They met while Tyler was visiting his aunt in the area and decided to settle down in Wyoming after his military service. They are currently living with Sarah's family in a spacious, three-bedroom house in a middle-class neighborhood near downtown Casper. While they appreciate the support and company, they are looking forward to moving into their own home soon.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Tyler is concerned about the state's economic dependence on the energy industry and the impact of fluctuations in the global market on local jobs. He is also worried about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly housing costs, which he believes are becoming unaffordable for many young families. Tyler values self-reliance and individual freedom, reflecting the strong Western ethos of Wyoming, but also recognizes the importance of community and government support for veterans and low-income families.\n\nTyler's economic priorities include affordable housing, job security, and access to quality healthcare, particularly for veterans. He is interested in policies that promote economic diversification, support small businesses, and address the unique challenges faced by rural communities in Wyoming."
