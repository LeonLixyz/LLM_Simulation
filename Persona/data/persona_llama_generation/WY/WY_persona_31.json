  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Elena Hern\u00e1ndez, an 18-year-old Mexican-American female who resides in the college town of Laramie, Wyoming. Born and raised in Wyoming to Mexican immigrant parents, Ana Elena is a US citizen by birth and identifies as Hispanic. She currently lives off-campus in a shared house with three non-relative housemates, all of whom are also students at the University of Wyoming.\n\nAna Elena is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science, with a focus on conservation biology. She is in her freshman year and is not currently in the labor force, dedicating most of her time to her studies. Her parents, though not highly educated themselves, have always emphasized the importance of education and have encouraged Ana Elena to pursue her passion for environmental science.\n\nAna Elena's parents own a small, successful landscaping business in Laramie, catering primarily to the university community and local residents. Although she does not work for her parents, Ana Elena's family income is relatively high, with her parents' combined income falling in the $80,000 range. This financial stability allows Ana Elena to focus on her studies without the burden of a part-time job.\n\nAna Elena speaks fluent English, having grown up in the US, but also speaks Spanish at home with her parents. She is proud of her Mexican heritage and actively participates in the university's Latinx student organization, where she helps organize cultural events and promotes diversity initiatives.\n\nAs a student, Ana Elena does not have health insurance coverage through an employer, but her parents' income qualifies her for a subsidized health insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act. Despite her family's relatively high income, Ana Elena's personal expenses are limited, and she relies on her parents for financial support.\n\nAna Elena's economic concerns are centered around the rising costs of higher education and the potential impact of climate change on her future career prospects. She is passionate about environmental conservation and hopes to pursue a career in sustainability after graduating. Her experiences as a first-generation college student and her involvement in the Latinx community have instilled in her a strong sense of social responsibility, which influences her views on economic and environmental policies."
