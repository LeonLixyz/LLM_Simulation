  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 57-year-old white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Emily was born in Colorado but has resided in Wyoming for over 30 years. She is a non-veteran, U.S. citizen who speaks English fluently. Emily holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained in 1990.\n\nEmily is married to her high school sweetheart, Tom, and they have been married for 32 years. They have two grown children who no longer live with them, but Emily's 88-year-old mother lives with them due to her advanced age and Emily's desire to care for her. Emily's marital status is 'now married, except separated,' but this refers to a brief period of separation in 2001 due to Tom's temporary relocation for work; they reconciled and have been together since.\n\nEmily works as an Environmental Consultant, earning $62,000 annually, and has been with her current employer for 12 years. Her job involves assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of construction projects in Wyoming. Emily's husband, Tom, is a retired high school teacher who now works part-time as a fishing guide.\n\nThe couple owns their home, a 2,500 sq. ft., three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they purchased in 1995 for $120,000. The current market value of their home is approximately $350,000. Emily's family is considered middle-class, with a combined annual household income of $85,000.\n\nEmily's primary economic concerns include saving for retirement, ensuring her mother receives proper care, and addressing the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly healthcare and housing. Her experience as an environmental consultant has also made her keenly aware of the importance of sustainable development and the need for policies that balance economic growth with environmental protection."
