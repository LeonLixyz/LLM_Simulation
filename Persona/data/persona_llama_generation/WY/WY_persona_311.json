  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 29-year-old white male who resides in the small town of Cody, Wyoming, specifically in the downtown area near the city center. Ethan is a high school graduate with a diploma from Cody High School, where he was an average student but excelled in vocational training programs, particularly in automotive repair. After high school, Ethan worked at a local mechanic shop for several years before moving on to become a maintenance supervisor at a nearby ranch, where he earns a steady income of $52,000 annually.\n\nEthan's marital status is divorced, having been married for about three years before separating due to irreconcilable differences. He is currently the primary householder of his residence, a modest, two-bedroom apartment he rents for $900 per month in a quiet neighborhood. Despite his divorce, Ethan remains on good terms with his ex-wife and occasionally meets up with her for casual, friendly gatherings.\n\nAs a non-veteran and a U.S. citizen born in Wyoming, Ethan has a strong sense of community and local pride. He spends most of his free time outdoors, enjoying activities such as hiking, fishing, and hunting in the nearby wilderness areas. Ethan is fluent in English and has no known ethnic affiliation, identifying primarily with the local culture of his hometown.\n\nEthan's economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and maintaining a comfortable lifestyle in a region with limited job opportunities and a relatively high cost of living. He is keenly aware of the importance of preserving Wyoming's natural resources and the need for sustainable economic development that balances growth with environmental protection. As a result, Ethan tends to support policies that promote local economic growth, conservation efforts, and accessible education and job training programs that can help young people in his community acquire in-demand skills.\n\nEthan's education background has influenced his career trajectory, and he acknowledges the value of vocational training in securing stable employment. He hopes to one day start his own business, possibly a small engine repair shop, and is interested in policies that support small business development and entrepreneurship in rural areas.\n\nGiven his experience as a divorced individual and his close relationship with his ex-wife, Ethan values policies that support family well-being, including access to affordable healthcare and education. He also believes in the importance of community programs that promote social cohesion and support for individuals going through difficult times.\n\nAssumption: For the null value of \"Ethnicity,\" it is assumed that Ethan does not identify with any specific ethnic group, given the lack of information and his strong identification with the local culture of his hometown."
