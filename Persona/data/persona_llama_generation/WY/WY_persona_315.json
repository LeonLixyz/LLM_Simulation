  "PERSONA": "Robert \"Bob\" Thompson, a 68-year-old male, resides in a modest, single-story home in a quiet neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in the state, Bob is a US citizen and has lived in Wyoming his entire life. He is married to his second wife, Karen, whom he met through mutual friends at a local community event. Although they are married, they maintain separate living arrangements due to Bob's preference for independence and his wife's career as a traveling nurse.\n\nAs the primary householder, Bob takes care of the mortgage on his $180,000 home, which he has been paying off for the past 15 years. His annual household income is approximately $55,000, mostly from his retirement pension and part-time work as a high school sports coach. Bob graduated from Cheyenne Central High School and later attended a local community college for a year before deciding to enter the workforce.\n\nBob's economic concerns are centered around maintaining his retirement savings, managing healthcare costs, and ensuring the stability of his pension. He is particularly interested in local and national policies affecting education and veterans' affairs, despite not being a veteran himself. His wife's experiences as a nurse have made him more aware of the healthcare system's complexities.\n\nAs a self-identified \"Other Race\" individual, Bob's ancestry is a mix of Native American and European descent, reflecting the diverse heritage of the region. He speaks English fluently and has no reported language barriers. Bob is proud of his Wyoming roots and actively participates in local community events, often volunteering at the Cheyenne Frontier Days and supporting local businesses."
