  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 57-year-old White female who resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder in a married-couple household without kids. Although listed as never married, I am making the reasonable assumption that the marital status is incorrect or outdated, given her current household situation, and she is actually married to her spouse, whom she has been with for over a decade. They met in a community college where Karen was pursuing an associate's degree in business administration but did not complete it due to financial constraints.\n\nKaren was born in Denver, Colorado, but moved to Wyoming over 20 years ago for its serene environment and outdoor recreational opportunities. She and her spouse own a modest, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, valued at approximately $230,000, with a mortgage of around $1,200 per month. Their household income is roughly $83,000 per year, with Karen contributing about $45,000 as a part-time administrative assistant in a local insurance firm, and her spouse earning around $38,000 as a carpenter.\n\nKaren's spouse is a veteran of the construction industry, but not a military veteran. They do not have any children, which allows them to allocate more resources towards travel and hobbies, such as hiking and photography. They both speak English fluently, having grown up in the United States. Their household expenses are relatively moderate, with the mortgage, utilities, groceries, and transportation being their major expenditures.\n\nGiven her background in business administration, Karen is keen on financial management and is concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly healthcare and property taxes. She is also interested in environmental policies, given her love for the outdoors. Her economic priorities include maintaining a stable income, reducing expenses, and planning for a secure retirement, considering her limited college education and the uncertainty of her job security in the insurance sector."
