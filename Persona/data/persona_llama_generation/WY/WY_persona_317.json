  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old White female and primary householder of a single-parent household with two children, ages 7 and 9. She is a veteran of the US Army, having served for six years before being honorably discharged. Born in Ohio, Alex has lived in various parts of the country due to her military service, eventually settling in Casper, Wyoming, where she has resided for the past five years.\n\nAlex's highest level of education is an associate's degree in business administration, which she pursued while in the military but did not complete due to her service obligations. She is fluent in English and has no proficiency in other languages. Despite not having completed her degree, her military experience and training have equipped her with valuable skills in logistics and management.\n\nAs a single mother, Alex works full-time as a supply chain coordinator for a local manufacturing firm in Casper, earning an annual salary of $52,000. Her job requires her to manage inventory, coordinate shipments, and ensure timely delivery of products. She is proud of her ability to balance work and parenting responsibilities, often relying on her military-honed discipline to keep her household organized.\n\nAlex owns a modest, three-bedroom home in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, which she purchased with the help of a VA loan. Her monthly mortgage payment is $1,200, and she also pays $150 for property taxes. Her household income is supplemented by child support payments from her children's father, which helps cover living expenses.\n\nAs a veteran and single mother, Alex's economic concerns revolve around providing stability and security for her children. She is particularly interested in policies that support affordable housing, quality education, and veterans' benefits. Her experience as a single parent has also made her advocate for policies that address the needs of single-parent households, such as affordable childcare and flexible work arrangements.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and camping, which Wyoming's natural beauty offers in abundance. She is also involved in local veterans' organizations and volunteers at her children's school, reflecting her commitment to community service and civic engagement."
