  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson, an 87-year-old white female, lives alone in a modest, two-bedroom house in the historic district of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She has been married to her husband, Henry, for 55 years, but due to his current health issues, they maintain a separate living arrangement for his care. Agnes holds a Master's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in 1968. Born in Billings, Montana, she moved to Wyoming in the early 1970s for her teaching career. Agnes worked as a high school English teacher for over three decades before retiring in 2002. Her annual retirement income is approximately $43,000, supplemented by her husband's pension and their joint savings.\n\nAgnes's household income places her in a relatively stable financial situation, but she is concerned about healthcare costs and potential changes to social security benefits. As a homeowner, she has seen her property taxes increase over the years and worries about the impact on her fixed income. Despite these concerns, Agnes values her independence and continues to be an active member of her community, volunteering at the local library and participating in neighborhood events. Her graduate education and teaching background have instilled in her a strong appreciation for lifelong learning and civic engagement.\n\nAgnes's primary language is English, which she speaks fluently, and she holds US citizenship by birth. Her veteran status is non-veteran, but her late brother served in the US Army during the Vietnam War, which has influenced her views on veterans' rights and support services. As a long-time resident of Wyoming, Agnes is familiar with the state's economic challenges and the importance of the energy and tourism industries to the local economy. Her economic priorities include preserving social security, reducing healthcare costs, and promoting affordable housing options for seniors."
