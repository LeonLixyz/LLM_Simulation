  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Morales, a 38-year-old divorced Mexican-American woman living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in New Mexico, she moved to Wyoming 10 years ago for work. Ana is the primary householder of her household, residing in a rented apartment in a modest neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. Despite being divorced, she maintains a close relationship with her ex-husband, who lives in the same city, and they co-parent their 10-year-old son who lives with his father.\n\nAna works as a freelance graphic designer, earning an annual income of $19,500. She has a high school equivalency diploma, which she obtained after dropping out of high school in the 10th grade due to family financial constraints. Her career path has been marked by a passion for art and design, but limited by her lack of formal education in the field. She has developed her skills through online courses and workshops, allowing her to build a portfolio and attract local clients.\n\nAna's economic concerns revolve around accessing affordable healthcare, as she lacks health insurance coverage. She relies on community clinics for her medical needs, which can be time-consuming and unpredictable. Her income is also a significant worry, as she struggles to make ends meet, especially with the rising costs of living in Cheyenne. Despite these challenges, Ana values her independence and is determined to build a stable life for herself.\n\nAna's daily life is marked by her dedication to her work and her son. She spends most of her free time designing and taking on new projects, while also ensuring she has quality time with her son. She is an avid fan of local art events and participates in Cheyenne's vibrant cultural scene whenever possible. Ana's language skills are a significant asset, as she speaks English fluently, having grown up in a bilingual household. However, she still maintains strong ties to her Mexican heritage, celebrating traditional holidays and cooking family recipes.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ana is aware of the state's conservative leanings but identifies as a moderate Democrat, prioritizing issues like affordable healthcare, education, and economic development. Her experiences as a single mother and a creative entrepreneur have shaped her views on the importance of social support systems and accessible opportunities for economic mobility."
