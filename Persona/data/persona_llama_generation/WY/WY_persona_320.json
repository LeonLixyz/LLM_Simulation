They reside in a single-family home in the suburbs of Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nMARITAL_STATUS: Never married, but in a long-term, committed relationship.\n\nVETERAN_STATUS: Non-Veteran.\n\nLANGUAGE: Speaks English only.\n\nENGLISH_PROFICIENCY: Speaks English well, which is consistent with being born and raised in the United States.\n\nEDUCATION: Russell attended Casper College in Wyoming but did not complete his degree in business administration due to financial constraints. He has since taken various certification courses to enhance his career prospects.\n\nBIRTH_PLACE: Born in the state of Nebraska but moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age.\n\nCITIZENSHIP: US Citizen by birth.\n\nBIRTH_DETAIL: Born in a different state, specifically Nebraska, but has spent most of his life in Wyoming.\n\nSTATE_NAME: Wyoming\n\nSTATE_ABBR: WY\n\nOccupation: Russell works as a senior sales representative for a local outdoor gear company in Cheyenne, leveraging his passion for the outdoors and his incomplete college education in business. His annual income is approximately $62,000, with benefits and a 401(k) plan.\n\nHomeownership: Russell and Emily own their single-family home in the suburbs of Cheyenne, with a mortgage of $150,000 and an estimated home value of $280,000.\n\nEconomic concerns: Russell's primary economic concerns revolve around retirement savings, healthcare costs, and the stability of his job in the face of an increasingly competitive outdoor gear market. He is also concerned about the impact of inflation on his fixed income during retirement.\n\nGiven his age, occupation, and marital status, Russell is likely to prioritize economic policies that address retirement security, affordable healthcare, and job stability."
