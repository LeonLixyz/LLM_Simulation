  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Susan Thompson, a white, English-speaking female who resides in a rural area of Wyoming. She lives with her 72-year-old husband, John, in a single-family home that they own in the town of Cody, Wyoming. As indicated by her household relationship status as an \"Other Relative of Householder,\" Susan lives with her husband and her 92-year-old mother, who requires care and assistance due to her advanced age. Susan is responsible for her mother's care, while her husband works part-time as a retired mechanic.\n\nSusan is a high school graduate, having completed her education at a local high school in Wyoming. She did not pursue higher education due to family obligations and personal preferences. Her lack of college education has somewhat limited her career opportunities, but she has always been content with her role as a homemaker and caregiver. \n\nSusan's husband, John, worked as a mechanic for over three decades and retired from a local garage five years ago. He now works part-time to supplement their income and maintain his skills. Susan and John's combined annual household income is around $55,000, with John's pension and part-time job providing the bulk of their earnings. They own their home, which is valued at around $250,000, and have a mortgage with approximately 10 years remaining.\n\nAs a couple, Susan and John prioritize saving for their future, particularly for their mother's care and potential long-term care expenses. They also aim to maintain their home and cover living expenses, including utilities, groceries, and transportation costs. They are concerned about the rising costs of healthcare, prescription medications, and the potential impact of economic downturns on their fixed income.\n\nSusan and John are US citizens, born in different states but having lived in Wyoming for over 30 years. They are fluent in English, and their language proficiency has never been a barrier to communication or social interaction. As non-veterans, they do not receive any veteran benefits but are grateful for the support they receive from local community organizations that cater to seniors and caregivers.\n\nSusan's primary economic concerns include ensuring her mother's care, managing their household expenses, and maintaining their home. She is also concerned about the availability and affordability of healthcare services in rural Wyoming. Her political priorities include supporting policies that address these concerns, such as expanding access to affordable healthcare, providing assistance for caregivers, and promoting economic development in rural areas."
