  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana\u00eds Garc\u00eda, a 29-year-old Hispanic female, born in New Mexico but currently residing in Laramie, Wyoming. Ana\u00eds is a divorced woman who lives with her new partner, Tom, a 32-year-old Wyoming native, in a rented two-bedroom apartment in the historic downtown area of Laramie. The couple does not have any children together, but Ana\u00eds has a close relationship with her 7-year-old son, Mateo, from her previous marriage, who lives with his father in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nAna\u00eds holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2020. Her educational background has led to a career as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm that specializes in sustainable land use and conservation. Her annual salary is around $55,000, and she works remotely most days, which allows her to have a flexible schedule and occasionally visit her son in New Mexico.\n\nAna\u00eds's partner, Tom, works as a high school teacher, and together they share a combined household income of around $90,000. They rent their apartment for $1,200 per month and have been considering purchasing a home in the area, but the rising housing costs in Laramie have made it challenging for them to find an affordable option.\n\nAna\u00eds's economic concerns include managing the cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing housing costs, and ensuring she can provide a stable financial future for herself and her son. She is also concerned about access to quality education and healthcare in rural areas, having experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating these systems for her son's needs.\n\nAna\u00eds is a US citizen, fluent in English, and has never served in the military. Her background and experiences have shaped her views on economic and environmental policies, with a strong emphasis on sustainability, education, and social welfare programs."
