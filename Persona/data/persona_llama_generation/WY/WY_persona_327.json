  "PERSONA": "A 68-year-old white female, living in a small town in Wyoming, named Cheyenne, with her husband of 45 years, in a married-couple household without children. She is the primary householder and has been a US citizen by birth, born in a different state, specifically Nebraska, but has resided in Wyoming for the past 20 years. She is a non-veteran and speaks only English, which she speaks well.\n\nShe has some college education but does not hold a degree, having attended the University of Wyoming for two years before dropping out to work and support her family. Her highest educational attainment is an associate's degree in business administration. Her husband, 70, is a retired mechanic and currently works part-time as a handyman.\n\nThe couple owns their home, a single-family residence in a rural area, with a mortgage that is nearly paid off. They have lived in this home for 15 years and have seen their property value increase significantly due to the growing popularity of Cheyenne as a tourist destination. Her annual household income is approximately $63,000, with her husband's part-time income and her own part-time work as a librarian at the local library contributing to their economic stability.\n\nShe has no dependents and her economic concerns are primarily focused on maintaining their current standard of living in retirement, ensuring access to quality healthcare, and mitigating the impact of inflation on their fixed income. She is particularly concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, especially the increasing property taxes on their home."
