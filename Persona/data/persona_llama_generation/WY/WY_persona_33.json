  "PERSONA": "Ana Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda is a 68-year-old Hispanic woman of Puerto Rican descent. She is a US citizen, born in New York, but has lived in Wyoming for the past 15 years. Ana Mar\u00eda is married to her second husband, John, who is 70 years old and a retired accountant. They reside in a spacious, two-story house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The house, valued at approximately $280,000, is owned by John, and Ana Mar\u00eda has been a stay-at-home wife since her marriage to him 12 years ago.\n\nAna Mar\u00eda's educational background includes two years of college, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. Before marrying John, Ana Mar\u00eda worked as a part-time administrative assistant for 10 years, earning around $35,000 annually. However, she decided to dedicate her time to her family and household after her marriage.\n\nAna Mar\u00eda's household income primarily comes from her husband's retirement savings and pension, which amounts to around $120,000 annually. Additionally, Ana Mar\u00eda receives a monthly stipend of $2,500 from her late father's trust fund, which he established before his passing. Their combined income places them in the $150,000 to $199,999 range.\n\nAs a non-working individual, Ana Mar\u00eda spends most of her time taking care of the household, gardening, and volunteering at a local animal shelter. She is fluent in English, having been born and raised in the US, and has no children of her own. However, she is very close to her step-children and step-grandchildren, who live in nearby cities and often visit during holidays.\n\nAna Mar\u00eda's primary economic concerns include maintaining a comfortable lifestyle during retirement, ensuring access to quality healthcare, and supporting her favorite charitable causes. She relies on public coverage, specifically Medicare, for her healthcare needs. As a resident of Wyoming, Ana Mar\u00eda values the state's low cost of living and scenic landscapes but is concerned about the rising costs of living and the impact of economic downturns on her household income."
