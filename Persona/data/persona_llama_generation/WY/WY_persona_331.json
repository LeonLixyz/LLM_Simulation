  "PERSONA": "Meet John Wilson, a 62-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He was born in Billings, Montana, but has lived in Wyoming for over 30 years. John is a US citizen by birth and speaks English as his primary language, which he speaks fluently. \n\nJohn is a non-veteran and has been married to his wife, Deborah, for 38 years. They have two adult children who have moved out, but John's 28-year-old son, Alex, has recently moved back in with them due to financial difficulties, making John's household relationship that of a child living with parents. John's household type is a single-family home that he and his wife own, which they've had for over two decades. The house is located in a suburban area of Cheyenne, with a mix of young families and retirees.\n\nJohn holds a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 1985. After completing his education, John worked in the banking sector for over 25 years, eventually becoming a bank manager before retiring in 2015. His wife, Deborah, is a retired school teacher. Their combined annual income from pensions and investments is around $85,000.\n\nJohn is concerned about the economic implications of retirement and the rising cost of living, particularly healthcare costs. He is also worried about the financial stability of his son, Alex, who is struggling to find a job in his field. These concerns shape John's views on economic policies, particularly those related to retirement security, healthcare, and job creation."
