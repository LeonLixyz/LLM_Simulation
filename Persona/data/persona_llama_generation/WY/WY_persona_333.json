  "PERSONA": "Meet Margaret \"Margie\" Thompson, a 68-year-old white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides with her husband, John, in a spacious, single-story house on the outskirts of the city, which they have owned since 1995. As a native of Wyoming, Margie was born and raised in the small town of Casper and has always called the state home. She is a proud US citizen and has never had to navigate the complexities of non-citizenship.\n\nMargie is well-educated, holding a Bachelor's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming. She graduated in 1978 and went on to have a fulfilling career as a high school English teacher in Casper and later in Cheyenne. She retired from teaching in 2010, after 32 years of service. Her husband, John, is a retired accountant, and they both enjoy their golden years, often spending time outdoors, hiking, and exploring Wyoming's natural beauty.\n\nMargie's household consists of her husband and herself. Her younger sister, who never married, lives with them, contributing to the household income by working part-time as a librarian at the local library. This living arrangement is a result of her sister's need for support after their parents passed away, and Margie is happy to provide a loving home.\n\nAs a homeowner, Margie and her husband have a relatively stable economic situation. Their combined retirement income, including pensions and Social Security benefits, is around $60,000 per year. They have no outstanding mortgage, having paid off their home loan several years ago. However, they do have some savings, which they use to supplement their retirement income and cover unexpected expenses.\n\nMargie's primary economic concerns include ensuring they have enough savings for potential long-term care and maintaining their standard of living amidst rising healthcare costs and inflation. She is also concerned about the impact of Wyoming's economic fluctuations, particularly in the energy sector, on the state's budget and her own retirement benefits.\n\nPolitically, Margie tends to lean conservative, reflecting her upbringing in a rural state with strong libertarian leanings. However, her years as a teacher have also given her a strong appreciation for the importance of public education and social services. She is likely to support policies that balance individual freedoms with the need for a robust social safety net, especially for seniors and vulnerable populations."
