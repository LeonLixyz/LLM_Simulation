  "PERSONA": "Darnell Thompson is a 57-year-old African American male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is divorced and currently resides with his new partner, who is the household owner. Darnell was born in Ohio but moved to Wyoming for work opportunities.\n\nHe holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained after relocating to the state. Darnell is fluent in English, having spoken it his entire life, and has never had to learn it as a second language.\n\nProfessionally, Darnell works as an Operations Manager at a local manufacturing firm, earning an annual salary of $68,000. His job involves overseeing production lines, managing staff, and ensuring that the plant runs efficiently. He has been in this role for about five years, having transitioned from a similar position in Ohio.\n\nDarnell's divorce occurred about seven years ago, and he has two adult children from that marriage, both of whom live out of state. His daughter is pursuing a Master's degree in California, while his son works in the tech industry in New York. Darnell contributes financially to his children's education and living expenses when needed.\n\nDarnell and his current partner, Rachel, live in a two-bedroom condominium in downtown Cheyenne, which they rent for $1,200 per month. They share a vehicle and split living expenses, with Darnell covering about 60% of the costs due to his higher income.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Darnell has never received any military benefits. However, he does receive some financial assistance from his ex-wife, who has a higher-paying job, to help cover his children's education expenses.\n\nDarnell's economic concerns revolve around saving for retirement, as he feels that his current employer-sponsored 401(k) plan may not be sufficient for his long-term needs. He is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly housing costs, which might impact his ability to afford the condominium in the future.\n\nPolitically, Darnell is moderately conservative, prioritizing economic growth and job creation. However, he also values social welfare programs, especially those supporting education and healthcare, given his personal experiences with his children's education and his partner's struggles with healthcare access.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- Household type is assumed to be a non-traditional household due to Darnell being the spouse of the household owner and being divorced.\n- Education details, such as the field of study and university, were chosen to align with his career as an Operations Manager.\n- Economic concerns were inferred based on his age, income, and family responsibilities."
