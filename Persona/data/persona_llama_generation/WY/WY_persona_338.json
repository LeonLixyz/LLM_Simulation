  "PERSONA": "Meet Deborah Wilson, a 62-year-old white female, born in the state of Oregon but now residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with her husband of 38 years, John. Deborah is the primary householder of their household, and she and her husband do not have any children. Deborah's educational background includes two years of community college, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree. This educational foundation has served her well in her career as an administrative assistant at a local insurance agency, a position she has held for over 20 years.\n\nDeborah's annual household income is around $62,000, with her husband contributing an additional $40,000 as a retired mechanic, bringing their combined income to $102,000. They own a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, valued at approximately $320,000, with a mortgage that is nearly paid off. Deborah's economic concerns include saving for retirement, managing healthcare costs, and maintaining their current standard of living. Given her background and circumstances, Deborah is likely to prioritize policies supporting affordable healthcare, retirement security, and local economic development.\n\nDeborah is fluent in English, speaks it well, and has been a US citizen by birth. Her marital status as \"now married, except separated\" indicates a long-term commitment to her marriage, suggesting stability and possibly conservative views on family values. Deborah's lack of veteran status and her husband's non-military background may influence her views on defense spending and foreign policy. Deborah's birth in a different state but long-term residence in Wyoming might shape her perspective on regional development and the role of the federal government in supporting local economies."
