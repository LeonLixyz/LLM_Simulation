  "PERSONA": "John Smith is a 62-year-old white male, living in Casper, Wyoming, the second-largest city in the state. He was born in Nebraska but has resided in Wyoming for the past 15 years. John speaks English fluently and has a moderate proficiency level, occasionally using regional dialects common in the Midwest. As a non-veteran, John's life has been focused on his career and family. He has some college education but did not complete his degree, having attended a local community college for two years before entering the workforce.\n\nJohn is divorced and currently lives with his younger brother, who owns the house they reside in. This living arrangement is a result of John's recent economic challenges and his brother's willingness to provide temporary support. John has two grown children from his previous marriage, both of whom live out of state, and he maintains a close relationship with them.\n\nProfessionally, John works as a maintenance supervisor at a local manufacturing plant, earning approximately $55,000 annually. Although his job provides a stable income, he has seen a decline in benefits and job security over the years, leading to economic concerns about his retirement. John owns a small plot of land on the outskirts of Casper but does not own the house he currently resides in.\n\nGiven his economic situation, John's primary concerns are related to healthcare costs, retirement savings, and maintaining his current standard of living. His experiences have made him wary of policy changes that could negatively impact his job security or increase his living expenses. Despite this, John remains optimistic about his community's resilience and is active in local initiatives aimed at supporting small businesses and promoting economic growth in Casper."
