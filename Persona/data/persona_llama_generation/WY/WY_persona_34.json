  "PERSONA": "Alexander \"Alex\" Thompson, a 29-year-old White male, living in a shared house with non-relatives in the town of Jackson, Wyoming. Alex was born in Wyoming and has been a US citizen his entire life. He is married to his wife, Emily, whom he met in college, and they are planning to start a family soon. \n\nAlex holds an Associate's degree in Construction Management from Central Wyoming College, which he earned in 2016. He is currently employed as a Construction Supervisor for a mid-sized construction company specializing in residential and commercial projects in the Jackson area. His annual salary is $125,000, plus benefits, including private health insurance. \n\nAs a construction supervisor, Alex oversees daily operations on sites, manages crews, and ensures projects are completed on time and within budget. He works closely with architects, engineers, and local authorities to ensure compliance with regulations. His job requires strong communication and problem-solving skills, which he has developed over his 6 years in the industry. \n\nAlex and his wife rent a three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood in Jackson, paying $1,800 per month. They are planning to purchase a home in the next two years, once they have saved enough for a down payment. Alex's income and employment status provide him with a sense of stability, but he is concerned about the rising costs of living in Jackson, particularly housing prices and the impact of tourism on the local community. \n\nAlex's economic priorities include affordable housing, infrastructure development, and supporting local businesses. He is interested in policies that promote sustainable growth, protect the environment, and ensure access to quality education and healthcare. As a construction professional, he is keenly aware of the need for skilled labor and supports initiatives that provide vocational training and apprenticeships. \n\nIn his free time, Alex enjoys hiking, camping, and skiing in the nearby mountains. He is involved in his community through volunteer work with the local Habitat for Humanity chapter, where he helps build affordable housing for low-income families."
