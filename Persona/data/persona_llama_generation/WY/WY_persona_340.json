  "PERSONA": "Alexandra 'Alex' Thompson, a 49-year-old white female living in a modest, single-family home in the suburbs of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder and has been married to her second husband, John, a 51-year-old high school teacher, for the past seven years. Although they do not have any children together, John has two grown children from his previous marriage who occasionally visit during holidays.\n\nAlex was born in Portland, Oregon, but moved to Wyoming 15 years ago for her job. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Oregon, which led to her career as an Environmental Consultant for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. Her job involves working closely with local communities to develop and implement sustainable practices, earning her an annual salary of $73,000.\n\nAs a homeowner, Alex is proud of her cozy, energy-efficient home in the historic district of Cheyenne, which she purchased for $280,000 eight years ago. Her mortgage, which she shares with her husband, is approximately $1,800 per month. She values her independence and financial security, which her stable job and marriage have provided.\n\nAlex's economic concerns include rising healthcare costs, especially since her husband's children have left the family insurance plan, and increasing property taxes that might affect her mortgage payments. She is also worried about the impact of climate change on Wyoming's economy, particularly in the agricultural and tourism sectors.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys volunteering for local environmental initiatives, hiking in the nearby mountains, and reading about sustainable living practices. She is fluent in English and has a strong appreciation for her community, which influences her political views on issues like conservation, education, and social welfare."
