  "PERSONA": "Meet Carlos Hernandez, a 68-year-old White male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Carlos is a native of the United States, born and raised in Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Maria, whom he met while they were both working at a local manufacturing plant. They have been married for over 40 years and have two adult children who have moved out of the family home.\n\nCarlos is a high school graduate and did not pursue higher education due to family financial constraints. He started working immediately after graduation and has spent most of his career in the manufacturing sector, with his last job being a machine operator at a local factory. He retired five years ago, after working for over 30 years, and is now living on a fixed income from his pension and social security benefits.\n\nCarlos is fluent in Spanish, which he learned from his parents, who were both of Mexican descent but were born in the United States. He also speaks English well, which he learned in school and through his work. Carlos and his wife live with their 45-year-old son, Juan, who has been unemployed for several years due to health issues. Juan's presence in the household has placed additional financial strain on Carlos and Maria, as they have to provide for his living expenses.\n\nThe Hernandez family owns their home, a modest three-bedroom house in a working-class neighborhood in Cheyenne. They purchased the house over 30 years ago, and it has been paid off for several years. However, they are struggling to keep up with property taxes and maintenance costs on their fixed income.\n\nCarlos's primary economic concerns are the rising costs of healthcare and the impact of inflation on his fixed income. He is worried that his pension and social security benefits will not keep pace with the increasing cost of living, and he is concerned about the financial burden that his son's unemployment has placed on the household. As a result, Carlos is likely to support policies that protect social security benefits, reduce healthcare costs, and promote job creation in his community."
