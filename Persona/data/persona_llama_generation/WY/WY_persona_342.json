  "PERSONA": "John Michael Davis, a 41-year-old White male, resides in the town of Jackson, Wyoming. He is a divorced father of two, having been married for about 8 years before the divorce. Despite the marital status change, John remains the spouse of the household due to shared custody arrangements and maintaining a close relationship with his ex-wife for the sake of their children. They live in a two-story, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood, which they own, having purchased it about 5 years ago.\n\nJohn holds a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of Wyoming College of Law. His educational background has been instrumental in his career as a successful lawyer specializing in environmental law. He currently works for a local law firm, focusing on cases related to land use and conservation. His annual income is approximately $120,000, which allows him to provide a comfortable life for his children, even with the financial responsibilities that come with shared custody.\n\nBorn in Colorado, John moved to Wyoming about 12 years ago for his undergraduate studies and decided to stay due to his love for the outdoors and the state's natural beauty. He is fluent in English and speaks it well, having been born and raised in the United States. John's economic concerns revolve around preserving Wyoming's natural resources for future generations while ensuring sustainable development and job creation in the state. His specific worries include the impact of climate change on local ecosystems and the need for more stringent environmental regulations.\n\nJohn's family structure is complex, with joint custody of his two children, ages 9 and 11, who split their time between his and his ex-wife's residences. This arrangement requires careful financial planning and time management. John prioritizes providing his children with quality education and ensuring they have a stable and loving environment, even if it means making personal sacrifices.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, John is particularly concerned about the economic implications of environmental policies on the local community. He supports policies that promote sustainable development, protect natural resources, and provide economic opportunities for residents. John's professional background and personal experiences have shaped his views on environmental conservation and its interplay with economic growth, making him an informed and engaged citizen in local and national discussions."
