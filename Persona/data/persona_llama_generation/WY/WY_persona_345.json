  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 62-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity. He is the primary householder of a married-couple household with kids, residing in the suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital city. Born in the United States, Juan was raised in Arizona before moving to Wyoming for better job opportunities. He holds US citizenship by birth and has never served in the military.\n\nJuan's educational background includes completing two years of college, where he studied business administration, but he did not obtain a degree due to financial constraints. This educational foundation has served him well in his career as a purchasing manager at a local manufacturing company, where he has been employed for over a decade. He earns an annual salary of $63,000, which allows him to provide a comfortable living for his family.\n\nJuan has been married to his wife, Maria, for 35 years, and they have two adult children: a 28-year-old son who works as an engineer and a 25-year-old daughter pursuing her master's degree in education. His family is fluent in English, and they only speak English at home, a trait Juan values as it has helped them integrate into their community.\n\nAs a homeowner, Juan is proud of the single-family house he purchased 15 years ago in a quiet suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne. The house is valued at $280,000, with a monthly mortgage payment of $1,400. Juan considers himself fortunate to have been able to build equity in his home, which he views as a key part of his retirement plan.\n\nJuan's economic concerns center around saving for retirement, ensuring his children are financially secure, and maintaining his current standard of living. He is particularly worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on his retirement savings. He values job security, affordable healthcare, and education, which are key factors influencing his political views and voting decisions.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Juan has witnessed firsthand the boom-and-bust cycles of the energy industry and its impact on the local economy. This experience has made him cautious about economic growth promises and has led him to prioritize policies that promote stable, long-term economic development. Despite the challenges, Juan remains optimistic about the future, attributing his positive outlook to his family's resilience and the strong community ties they have built in Cheyenne."
