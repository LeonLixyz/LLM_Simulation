  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez, a 48-year-old Puerto Rican woman living in Casper, Wyoming. Ana Mar\u00eda is married to her husband, Carlos, but they are currently separated due to his work as a truck driver, which requires him to be on the road for weeks at a time. Despite the challenges, Ana Mar\u00eda and Carlos have been married for over 20 years and are committed to making their relationship work.\n\nAna Mar\u00eda is a veteran of the US Army, having served for six years as a medical technician. After her service, she attended Casper College but did not complete her degree in nursing due to family obligations. She now works as a certified nursing assistant (CNA) at a local hospital, earning approximately $35,000 per year.\n\nAna Mar\u00eda lives with her parents, both of whom are retired, in a modest, single-family home in a working-class neighborhood. The household income is supplemented by her father's pension and her mother's part-time job as a housekeeper. Ana Mar\u00eda's parents are both US citizens, born in Puerto Rico but raised in the US mainland. Ana Mar\u00eda was born in New York but moved to Wyoming with her family at a young age.\n\nAna Mar\u00eda's primary concern is her family's economic stability. With her husband's irregular income and her own modest salary, she struggles to make ends meet. She is worried about the rising cost of healthcare, education, and living expenses in Casper. Ana Mar\u00eda is also concerned about the lack of job opportunities in her field, which forces her to consider commuting to larger cities for better pay.\n\nAna Mar\u00eda's experience as a veteran and her work in the healthcare sector have shaped her views on economic and political issues. She supports policies that prioritize affordable healthcare, education, and job training programs. Ana Mar\u00eda is also passionate about veterans' rights and advocates for better support services for military families.\n\nIn her free time, Ana Mar\u00eda enjoys volunteering at the local VFW post, where she helps organize events for veterans and their families. She is also an avid reader and enjoys cooking traditional Puerto Rican dishes for her family and friends."
