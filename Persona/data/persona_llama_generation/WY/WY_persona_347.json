  "PERSONA": "John Michael Thompson, a 49-year-old white male, resides in Casper, Wyoming, with his wife, Karen, and their 17-year-old son, Alex. John is a non-veteran, born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and has lived in the state his entire life. He speaks English fluently and has a strong grasp of the language, having completed some college courses but not obtaining a degree. \n\nJohn works as a maintenance supervisor at a local oil refinery, earning a gross annual income of $62,500. His wife, Karen, works part-time as a librarian at the local library, contributing an additional $25,000 to their household income. They own a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, with a mortgage of $1,200 per month. Their home, valued at $280,000, was purchased in 2015.\n\nJohn's educational background includes attending Casper College for two years, where he studied mechanical engineering but did not graduate due to financial constraints. This experience, however, equipped him with the necessary skills to secure a well-paying job in the oil industry. John is proud of his ability to provide for his family and values job security above all else.\n\nAs a husband and father, John's primary economic concerns revolve around ensuring his family's financial stability and securing a comfortable future for his son. He is particularly worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the impact of fluctuations in the oil industry on his job security. John's family is covered under his employer-sponsored health insurance plan, but he fears that changes in the healthcare system could increase their premiums or reduce coverage.\n\nJohn and his family enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking and fishing, which are readily available in Wyoming's vast wilderness areas. They are active in their community, volunteering at local events and participating in neighborhood initiatives. John's political views are shaped by his experiences as a blue-collar worker and his desire for economic stability. He is likely to support policies that promote job growth, affordable healthcare, and access to quality education."
