  "PERSONA": "John Michael Davis, a 38-year-old White male, resides in the town of Jackson, Wyoming. As the primary householder, John lives alone in a rented, two-bedroom apartment in the downtown area, which he pays $1,200 per month for. He was born in Colorado but has lived in Wyoming for the past eight years.\n\nJohn is a widower, having lost his wife to cancer three years ago. He has no children. He holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from a local community college and works as a service manager at a car dealership in Jackson, earning $55,000 annually. His job requires him to manage a team of mechanics, handle customer complaints, and maintain the service department's budget.\n\nJohn speaks English fluently, having been born and raised in the United States. He is a U.S. citizen by birth and has never served in the military. He has a decent understanding of financial planning and manages his finances conservatively, allocating 30% of his income towards rent, 20% towards savings, and the remainder for expenses and entertainment.\n\nGiven his economic situation, John's primary concerns are maintaining job security, affording healthcare, and planning for retirement. He worries about the rising cost of living in Jackson, particularly the increasing rent prices, and hopes for more affordable housing options in the future. John's educational background and career trajectory have provided him with a stable income, but he aspires to start his own business one day, possibly a small-scale automotive repair shop.\n\nAs a single male without kids, John's social life revolves around his colleagues, acquaintances, and participation in local community events. He values independence but also appreciates the sense of community in Jackson. John's experiences as a widower have taught him to appreciate the importance of social connections and support networks."
