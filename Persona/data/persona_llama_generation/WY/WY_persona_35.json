  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 27-year-old white female, born in Oregon, USA, but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan, and lives with her parents in a spacious suburban home in the southeastern part of the city. Alex's parents, both in their early sixties, are retired and own the house, which they built in the late 1990s.\n\nAlex holds an associate's degree in nursing from Laramie County Community College, which she completed in 2018. She works as a registered nurse (RN) at Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, specializing in pediatrics. Her job requires her to work varied shifts, including some nights and weekends, but provides a stable income of $85,000 per year. Her husband, Ryan, works as an accountant in a local firm, earning a similar income. Together, they have a combined household income of around $170,000.\n\nThe couple has been trying to start a family but has not yet been successful. They are currently saving up for a down payment on a house, hoping to move out of Alex's childhood home within the next two years. Alex is grateful for the opportunity to live with her parents, as it allows them to save money and focus on their future goals.\n\nAlex is fluent in English and has never had any issues with language barriers. She has private health insurance through her employer, which also covers her husband. In her free time, Alex enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. She is also an avid reader and volunteers at a local children's hospital.\n\nAs a healthcare professional, Alex is deeply concerned about access to quality healthcare, especially in rural areas. She has seen firsthand the challenges faced by patients who struggle to afford medical care and believes that affordable healthcare should be a fundamental right. Alex is also passionate about education and supports policies that promote affordable higher education and vocational training. Her economic priorities include affordable housing, job security, and a living wage."
