  "PERSONA": "John Taylor, a 68-year-old White male living in a rural area of Wyoming, specifically in the town of Cody. He resides with his 92-year-old mother in a single-family home that has been in the family for over three generations. The house is modest, with three bedrooms and a small backyard, which John maintains meticulously. Although he never married, John's life has been centered around family, particularly his mother, whom he has cared for since his father's passing 10 years ago.\n\nJohn completed high school in his hometown in another state before moving to Wyoming in his early twenties to work on a ranch. Over the years, he transitioned to working as a maintenance worker for the local school district, a job he held until his retirement five years ago. His annual retirement income is approximately $45,000, which includes a small pension and social security benefits.\n\nDespite never attending college, John values education highly, largely due to his mother's influence. She was a teacher before retirement, and her emphasis on the importance of learning has stuck with John throughout his life. This appreciation for education is one of the reasons he supports local initiatives to improve the funding and quality of schools in his area.\n\nJohn's economic concerns are centered around healthcare, especially as it pertains to his mother's needs. He is worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential for changes in Medicare, which he relies on for his and his mother's medical expenses. He also keeps a close eye on local economic development, hoping for growth that does not compromise the natural beauty and small-town feel of Cody.\n\nPolitically, John leans conservative, influenced by his upbringing and the community values of rural Wyoming. However, his experiences as a caregiver and his concerns about healthcare have made him more open to considering liberal policies that could benefit seniors and those in need of medical care. John's political engagement is mostly limited to voting and occasional letters to his local representatives, but he is keenly interested in how policy decisions will affect his life and the lives of those around him.\n\nJohn's daily routine is quiet, with mornings spent tending to his garden and afternoons often filled with reading or fixing things around the house. He values simplicity and community, finding joy in the quiet life of Cody and the familiarity of his long-held traditions."
