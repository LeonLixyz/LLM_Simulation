  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 38-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, residing in Casper, Wyoming. Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Juan moved to Wyoming for work and has been living there for about 5 years. He is the spouse of the household, and although he is in a long-term, committed relationship, he and his partner have chosen not to get married. Juan's partner, Emily, is the household's primary earner, working as a high school teacher, while Juan works as a mid-level manager at a local non-profit organization focused on environmental conservation, earning a salary of $62,000 per year.\n\nJuan holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of New Mexico. He speaks English fluently, having grown up in the United States, and has never served in the military. Juan's educational background has significantly influenced his career trajectory, allowing him to secure a job that aligns with his passion for environmental conservation. He is proud of his Mexican heritage and celebrates traditional holidays and cultural events with his family and friends.\n\nThe couple rents a two-bedroom apartment in a mixed-use development in downtown Casper, paying $1,200 per month. They do not have any children but are considering starting a family in the near future. Juan's economic concerns revolve around saving for a down payment on a house, paying off student loans, and ensuring a stable financial future for his potential family. He is keenly interested in local politics, particularly policies related to environmental protection, education, and affordable housing. Juan's perspective on economic and political issues is shaped by his experiences as a Hispanic male in a predominantly white state, his commitment to environmental conservation, and his desire for financial security."
