  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old James \"Jim\" Thompson, a retired mechanic living in a small, rural town in Wyoming with his partner, Lisa, whom he met through mutual friends at a local diner about a decade ago. Jim was born in rural Nebraska but moved to Wyoming in his mid-30s for better job opportunities in the automotive industry. He is a U.S. citizen by birth and has never served in the military.\n\nJim and Lisa reside in a modest, two-bedroom house on the outskirts of Cody, Wyoming, which they purchased in 2007 for $170,000. They have been cohabiting without any children, a situation that has allowed them to maintain a relatively simple and cost-effective lifestyle. Their home is valued at approximately $250,000, reflecting the steady growth in property values in the area.\n\nJim has a somewhat complicated marital history, having been divorced from his first wife in 1999 after 17 years of marriage. The divorce was amicable, and they remain on good terms, primarily for the sake of their adult children from that marriage, who are now living independently in different parts of the country.\n\nEducationally, Jim attended a local community college in Wyoming for two years, studying automotive repair and business management, but he never completed his degree. This educational background, combined with his years of experience working in various garages and finally owning his own repair shop, equipped him with the skills to run a successful small business until his retirement in 2018.\n\nJim's annual pension from his years of work, combined with Lisa's part-time income from her job at a local library, amounts to about $55,000. This income allows them to live comfortably, covering their mortgage, utilities, groceries, and occasional trips to visit their children and grandchildren.\n\nJim's economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs, particularly the rising premiums for Medicare and supplemental insurance, which take a significant portion of their income. He also worries about the local economy's reliance on tourism and how fluctuations in visitor numbers can impact the community's stability.\n\nPolitically, Jim is a moderate conservative, influenced by his upbringing in a rural area and his experiences as a small business owner. He values self-reliance and limited government intervention in economic matters but also believes in the importance of social safety nets and public services like libraries and community centers, which he sees as essential for the well-being of the community.\n\nJim's leisure activities include fishing, woodworking, and volunteering at a local historical society, where he helps maintain classic cars. He is fluent in English, speaks it well, and has no other languages spoken at home. Despite the challenges faced by his community, Jim remains optimistic about the future, believing in the resilience of the people and the natural beauty of Wyoming as enduring strengths."
