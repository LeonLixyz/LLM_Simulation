  "PERSONA": "Margaret \"Maggie\" Thompson, a 69-year-old white female, residing in the small town of Cody, Wyoming. Maggie is the primary householder of her single-family home, which she owns outright, having paid off her mortgage 10 years ago. She lives alone but is married to her second husband, John, 72, who is currently living in a nearby assisted living facility due to early-stage dementia. They have been married for 12 years, and despite his health issues, they remain close, with Maggie visiting him daily.\n\nMaggie was born in Illinois but moved to Wyoming 20 years ago to be closer to her niece and nephew after her sister passed away. She holds a deep affection for the wide-open spaces and outdoor lifestyle Wyoming offers. Before moving, Maggie worked as a part-time administrative assistant for a small insurance firm, but since relocating, she has been semi-retired, occasionally taking on freelance administrative work for local businesses to stay active and engaged.\n\nMaggie attended community college for two years, studying business administration, but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. Her education background has served her well in her administrative roles, and she is proud of her self-taught computer skills, which she continues to update.\n\nMaggie's annual income is approximately $43,000, derived from her part-time work, her husband's pension, and their combined social security benefits. She is meticulous about her finances, prioritizing saving for unexpected medical expenses and ensuring she can continue to support herself and contribute to John's care.\n\nLiving in Cody, Maggie enjoys a relatively low cost of living but is concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the impact of state budget cuts on local services. She is an avid follower of local politics and state legislative decisions, particularly those affecting senior citizens and rural communities. Maggie values independence and self-reliance but also believes in the importance of community support and social services for those in need.\n\nMaggie's daily life revolves around her visits to John, her freelance work, and her hobbies, which include gardening, reading historical novels, and participating in a local book club. Despite the challenges of her husband's condition, Maggie remains optimistic and engaged, drawing strength from her community and the natural beauty of Wyoming."
