  "PERSONA": "Meet Rafael Morales, a 68-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, residing in the city of Casper, Wyoming. Rafael is a lifelong bachelor who currently lives with his younger sister, Ana, in a modest, two-bedroom house they jointly own in a mixed-income neighborhood near downtown Casper. As an \"other relative of the householder,\" Rafael contributes to the household income and expenses, helping to maintain a comfortable living situation.\n\nRafael was born in Tucson, Arizona, but has called Wyoming home for over a decade. He holds an Associate's degree in automotive technology from a local community college, which led to a fulfilling career as a service manager at a mid-sized car dealership in Casper. After 20 years of dedicated service, Rafael semi-retired, transitioning to a part-time role as a consultant for the dealership, which provides a steady income of $48,000 annually.\n\nAs a homeowner, Rafael has a mortgage of $120,000 on their house, valued at $180,000. He shares household expenses with his sister, who works as a nurse at the local hospital, earning a salary of $60,000. Their combined household income is $108,000. Rafael's financial priorities include saving for retirement, paying off their mortgage, and covering his sister's children's education expenses, as they occasionally contribute to their nieces' and nephews' college funds.\n\nRafael's education and career path have significantly influenced his economic views. He is concerned about the availability of vocational training programs and apprenticeships, believing that these opportunities can provide young people with valuable skills and job security. As a small business consultant, Rafael is also interested in policies that support local entrepreneurship and economic growth in rural areas like Casper.\n\nAs a never-married individual, Rafael's social network consists of close family ties and friendships developed through his work and community involvement. He volunteers at a local non-profit organization that provides car repairs and maintenance services to low-income families, reflecting his commitment to giving back to the community.\n\nRafael's experience living in a rural state like Wyoming has shaped his perspective on issues like access to healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. He is eager to see policies that address the unique challenges faced by rural communities, such as limited job opportunities, inadequate internet connectivity, and strained healthcare resources.\n\nIn his free time, Rafael enjoys hiking, fishing, and restoring classic cars. He is fluent in English and has a deep appreciation for his Mexican heritage, often celebrating traditional holidays and cooking family recipes with his sister and their extended family.\n\nAssumptions made based on the provided metadata:\n\n* Rafael's household type is assumed to be a multi-generational household, given his relationship as \"other relative of the householder.\"\n* Rafael's language proficiency is assumed to be strong, as he speaks English well and has lived in the United States his entire life."
