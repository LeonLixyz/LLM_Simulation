  "PERSONA": "Meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 62-year-old White female, residing in the picturesque town of Jackson, Wyoming. She is a primary household member and has been married to her husband, Michael, for over 35 years. They have no children together, a choice they made early in their marriage to focus on their careers and personal interests. \n\nAlex was born in Oregon but moved to Wyoming 20 years ago to pursue a career in environmental conservation, leveraging her graduate degree in Environmental Science from the University of Oregon. She works as a senior environmental consultant for a local firm, earning an annual income of $83,000. Her job involves advising on sustainable practices in the tourism and agriculture sectors, which are significant contributors to Wyoming's economy.\n\nAlex and her husband own a cozy, two-bedroom home in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Jackson. Their home, valued at $420,000, is a significant investment and a source of pride for them. They have a mortgage of $250,000 with a monthly payment of $1,500. \n\nAlex is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently. She holds a professional certification in environmental management and is well-respected in her community for her expertise. Her graduate education has been instrumental in her career advancement and has allowed her to contribute meaningfully to Wyoming's environmental policies.\n\nAs a homeowner in a popular tourist destination, Alex is concerned about the impact of tourism on local infrastructure and the environment. Her economic priorities include preserving Wyoming's natural beauty while supporting sustainable economic growth. She is also keenly interested in policies that promote affordable housing, as she has seen the challenges faced by young professionals and families in finding affordable homes in Jackson.\n\nAlex's marital status and long-term marriage reflect her commitment to partnership and community. Her husband, Michael, is a semi-retired high school teacher who now works part-time at a local outdoor gear store. Together, they enjoy hiking, skiing, and volunteering for local conservation projects.\n\nGiven her age and career stage, Alex is nearing retirement but plans to continue working part-time to stay engaged and contribute to her community. Her concerns about retirement savings, healthcare, and social security are typical for someone in her demographic, influencing her views on economic and political policies affecting seniors and retirees."
