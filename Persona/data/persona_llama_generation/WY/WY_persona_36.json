  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old White and Native American male, who was born in Oklahoma but currently resides in Casper, Wyoming. As a divorced father of two, Ryan is the primary householder of a household that, despite his marital status, still functions as a married-couple with kids due to shared custody arrangements. He lives with his 10-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter in a modest, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, which he owns with a mortgage. \n\nRyan is a high school graduate who did not pursue higher education due to his enlistment in the U.S. Army shortly after graduation. He served for six years, during which time he developed mechanical skills that he now applies in his job as a diesel mechanic at a local trucking company. His experience in the military and current career in transportation occupations have instilled in him a strong work ethic and appreciation for the importance of reliable transportation infrastructure.\n\nWith an annual income of $29,500, Ryan struggles to make ends meet, especially with the financial responsibilities of raising two children on his own. His income is supplemented by child support payments from his ex-wife, who lives in the same city to facilitate co-parenting. Despite these challenges, Ryan is proud of his ability to provide for his family, largely thanks to his job's private health insurance coverage, which is crucial for managing his children's health needs.\n\nRyan's economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and the cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the rising costs of housing and education. As a veteran, he also advocates for better support services for veterans transitioning to civilian life. Politically, Ryan leans towards policies that promote economic growth, improve access to affordable healthcare, and support veterans' welfare. His voting decisions are influenced by how these policies might impact his family's well-being and his ability to provide a stable future for his children."
