  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 49-year-old white male living in Casper, Wyoming. He resides with his parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, where he has spent most of his life. Ryan is married to his wife, Sarah, whom he met in college, but they currently live with his parents due to financial constraints. They have no children of their own.\n\nRyan holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Casper College, which he obtained in 2002. After completing his education, he worked as an auto mechanic for several years before transitioning to a sales position at a local car dealership, where he has been employed for over a decade. His current annual income is around $55,000.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Ryan has never served in the military. Born and raised in Wyoming, he speaks only English and has never had to learn another language. His education and career trajectory have been shaped by his decision to pursue a technical degree, which has allowed him to maintain a stable, middle-class lifestyle in his hometown.\n\nRyan's living situation with his parents, however, reflects the economic challenges he and his wife face. Despite being married, they struggle to afford their own home, highlighting the difficulties of achieving financial independence in a region with a relatively high cost of living. This situation influences Ryan's economic concerns, as he prioritizes affordable housing and job security.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ryan is deeply rooted in the local community and is likely influenced by the state's conservative leanings. His experiences as a small-town resident, coupled with his reliance on the automotive industry, may shape his views on economic policies, particularly those related to trade, energy, and infrastructure development."
