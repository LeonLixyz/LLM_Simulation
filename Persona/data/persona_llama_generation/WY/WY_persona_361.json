  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 28-year-old white female, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. She currently resides in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, the state capital, with her parents and her husband, whom she married two years ago.\n\nAlex holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed three years ago. Her education has equipped her with a strong foundation in sustainability and conservation, but she has found it challenging to secure a job in her field due to the limited job market in Wyoming. As a result, she works part-time as an administrative assistant at a local non-profit organization focused on environmental conservation, earning an annual salary of $32,000. Her husband, a 30-year-old high school teacher, is the primary breadwinner, with an annual income of $55,000.\n\nAlex and her husband rent a two-bedroom apartment in a modest complex near her parents' house, paying $900 per month. They are currently saving to purchase their own home, hoping to take advantage of Wyoming's relatively low housing costs. However, they are concerned about the impact of the state's economic fluctuations, particularly in the energy sector, on the housing market and their future financial stability.\n\nAs a married couple living with her parents, Alex and her husband contribute to the household expenses, including groceries and utilities, but they also benefit from the shared living arrangement, which allows them to save money and pay off their student loans. Alex's parents, both in their early sixties, are retired and own the house, which they purchased over two decades ago.\n\nAlex's primary economic concerns include paying off her student loans, which total $20,000, and saving for a down payment on a house. She is also worried about the impact of climate change on Wyoming's economy and the potential consequences for her future career prospects in the environmental sector. As a result, she is likely to support policies that prioritize sustainable development, education, and job creation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nIn her free time, Alex volunteers at local environmental organizations and participates in community events focused on sustainability and conservation. She is an avid hiker and enjoys exploring Wyoming's natural landscapes with her husband and their two-year-old golden retriever, Max."
