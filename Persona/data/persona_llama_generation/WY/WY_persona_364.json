  "PERSONA": "Name: Meena Patel, a 38-year-old Asian woman, specifically of Indian descent, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married but separated, and as the primary householder, she resides alone in a rented two-bedroom apartment in a suburban neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. Meena was born in the United States, specifically in Wyoming, where she has lived her entire life. She speaks English fluently, having never spoken another language at home.\n\nMeena's educational background includes two years of college, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree due to financial constraints. She currently works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance firm, earning approximately $35,000 annually. Despite her modest income, she manages her finances prudently, allocating a portion of her income towards savings and investments.\n\nMeena's marital status as \"now married, except separated\" indicates a recent separation from her husband. She has been focusing on rebuilding her life, prioritizing her career and personal growth. This experience has influenced her economic concerns, as she is keenly interested in policies supporting single individuals and women's economic empowerment.\n\nHer specific economic concerns include affordable healthcare, as she struggles to cover medical expenses with her current income. Meena is also interested in local economic development initiatives that could lead to better job opportunities and higher wages. Her experience as a renter has made her aware of the need for affordable housing options, and she supports policies that address this issue.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Meena is exposed to a mix of urban and rural environments, which has shaped her views on economic growth and resource management. She values the natural beauty of her state and supports sustainable practices that balance economic development with environmental protection. As a single, working woman, Meena's economic and political views are centered around self-sufficiency, economic growth, and social support systems that empower individuals like herself."
