  "PERSONA": "Meet Maria Elena Hernandez, a 79-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a widow and the spouse of the household's former primary breadwinner. Given her marital status, I assume she is living with her adult children or other relatives, as the household type is not specified. \n\nMaria Elena was born in California but has lived in Wyoming for over two decades. She holds an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education, which she obtained from a local community college after her children were old enough to attend school. Before retiring, she worked as a preschool teacher's assistant in a local elementary school for 15 years.\n\nAs a widow, Maria Elena's economic situation is largely dependent on her late husband's pension and her own modest savings. Her annual income is around $35,000, which is comprised of her husband's pension ($20,000) and her own retirement savings ($15,000). She owns the house she lives in, which was fully paid off by her husband before his passing. The house is in a quiet suburban neighborhood with a mix of retirees and young families.\n\nMaria Elena's economic concerns are mainly centered around maintaining her current standard of living, ensuring she has enough money for medical expenses, and contributing to her grandchildren's education funds. She is fluent in English, having spoken it her entire life, but still maintains strong ties to her Mexican heritage through family traditions and cultural practices.\n\nAs a retired educator, Maria Elena values education highly and believes it is key to economic mobility. She is likely to support policies that promote accessible and affordable education, as well as those that benefit retirees and the elderly, such as pension protection and healthcare reform. Her experience as a widow living on a fixed income also makes her sensitive to economic policies that impact the cost of living, especially in areas like healthcare and housing."
