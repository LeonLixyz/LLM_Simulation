  "PERSONA": "John Thompson, a 62-year-old white male, is the primary householder of a single-person household in a small town in Wyoming, specifically in the outskirts of Cheyenne, where he was born and raised. He has never been married and does not have any children. John is a U.S. citizen by birth and has always resided in Wyoming, maintaining strong ties to his local community.\n\nJohn's educational background includes two years of college at Laramie County Community College, where he studied automotive repair. However, he did not complete his degree, instead opting to enter the workforce early to support himself. This decision was largely influenced by his family's financial situation at the time, as his parents were struggling to make ends meet. John's early entry into the workforce allowed him to gain practical experience and eventually secure a stable job as a mechanic at a local auto repair shop in Cheyenne.\n\nJohn's job as a mechanic at \"Cheyenne Auto Repairs\" pays him $55,000 per year, which is slightly above the median income for his profession in Wyoming. He takes pride in his work and is well-respected in his community for his reliability and expertise. Despite not owning the business, John feels a sense of accomplishment in being able to support himself and contribute to the local economy.\n\nJohn rents a modest, two-bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood for $800 per month, which accounts for about 17% of his gross income. He has been renting the same house for over 10 years and has developed a good relationship with his landlord, who is also a local business owner. John values the stability and predictability of his rental situation, which allows him to plan his finances effectively.\n\nJohn's economic concerns are centered around the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing prices of healthcare and housing. As someone who has always lived in the state, John is keenly aware of the changes in the local economy and the impact of tourism on the cost of living. He is also concerned about the potential effects of economic downturns on his job security and the overall well-being of his community.\n\nIn his free time, John enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing, which are readily available in Wyoming's vast natural landscapes. He is an avid supporter of local conservation efforts and often participates in community initiatives aimed at preserving the state's natural beauty.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Based on John's birthplace and residence, it is assumed that his ethnicity is non-Hispanic, as the majority of the population in Wyoming is non-Hispanic white.\n- Given John's age and occupation, it is assumed that he has some form of health insurance, possibly through his employer or a private provider, although the specifics are not provided in the metadata."
