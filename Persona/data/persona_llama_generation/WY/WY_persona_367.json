  "PERSONA": "A 38-year-old divorced white female, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as the spouse of the household. She is a high school graduate, born in a different state, but has been a resident of Wyoming for several years. She is a US citizen, fluent in English, and has no known ethnicity. \n\nAssuming she married her current spouse after her divorce, she lives in a household with her partner, who is likely the primary breadwinner, given her marital status as a spouse. This assumption is based on the household relationship information provided. The household type is assumed to be a non-traditional family setup, possibly a blended family or a household with a partner and no children, considering her marital history.\n\nShe works as a part-time administrative assistant in a local hospital, earning around $35,000 annually. Her job is relatively stable but offers limited career growth opportunities, which she is willing to accept due to the need for flexibility in her personal life. Her high school education has somewhat limited her career prospects, but she has developed strong administrative skills through on-the-job training.\n\nShe rents a two-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood, with a monthly rent of around $900. Her partner contributes significantly to the household income, helping to cover living expenses. Despite being divorced, she values her independence and contributes to household expenses through her part-time job.\n\nHer primary economic concerns are affording healthcare, managing debt from her previous marriage, and saving for retirement. She is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly housing costs, which might force her to consider relocating to a more affordable area.\n\nPolitically, she leans towards moderate conservatism, valuing individual freedom and limited government intervention in personal life. However, her experiences as a divorced woman and her concerns about healthcare and economic stability might make her more open to social welfare policies that support low- and middle-income families."
