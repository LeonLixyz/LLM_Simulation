  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Emily, and they reside in a two-story, three-bedroom home in the historic district of downtown Cheyenne, which they purchased for $270,000 five years ago. Ryan's wife is the primary breadwinner, working as a pediatrician at Cheyenne Regional Medical Center. Ryan works as a data analyst for the Wyoming State Government, earning an annual salary of $62,000. His job involves analyzing economic trends and providing insights for state policymakers.\n\nRyan was born in Boulder, Colorado, but grew up in various parts of the country due to his family's frequent relocations during his childhood. He holds a Master's degree in Economics from the University of Wyoming, which he completed in 2009. Ryan's educational background has been instrumental in his career, providing him with a strong foundation in data analysis and economic theory.\n\nRyan and his wife have two children, ages 7 and 9, who attend a local public elementary school. As a spouse of the household, Ryan takes on significant childcare responsibilities, often managing the daily schedules of his children and ensuring they get to their extracurricular activities on time. The family enjoys outdoor activities, such as hiking and camping, which Wyoming's natural beauty readily provides.\n\nRyan's primary economic concerns revolve around providing a stable financial future for his family. With a mortgage, two car payments, and the rising costs of living in Cheyenne, Ryan is keenly aware of the need for careful budgeting and smart financial planning. He is also interested in local economic development initiatives that could create more job opportunities and stimulate growth in the region. Given his background in economics and his role in state government, Ryan has a nuanced understanding of the interplay between policy decisions and their impact on local communities."
