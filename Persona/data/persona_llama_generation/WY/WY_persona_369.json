  "PERSONA": "A 38-year-old white female, named Sarah, who is the primary householder in a married-couple household with two children, ages 8 and 10. She is married to her husband, John, a 40-year-old high school physics teacher, and they have been married for 12 years. Sarah's husband is the primary breadwinner, earning $65,000 per year, while she works part-time as a dental hygienist, earning $35,000 per year. They own a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with a mortgage of $1,200 per month.\n\nSarah was born in Denver, Colorado, but has lived in Wyoming for the past 10 years. She has some college education but did not complete her degree in dental hygiene due to financial constraints. Despite this, she was able to secure a well-paying part-time job at a local dental clinic. Sarah's English proficiency is excellent, and she speaks only English at home.\n\nThe family's household income is $100,000 per year, which allows them to afford a relatively comfortable lifestyle. However, they struggle to save for their children's college education and worry about the rising costs of healthcare. Sarah's primary economic concerns are the increasing costs of living in Wyoming, particularly the rising housing costs, and the need for better job opportunities in the state.\n\nSarah is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. She is actively involved in her children's school and participates in local parent-teacher association meetings. Her family's economic situation and concerns about the future drive her political views, with a focus on education, healthcare, and economic development in Wyoming."
