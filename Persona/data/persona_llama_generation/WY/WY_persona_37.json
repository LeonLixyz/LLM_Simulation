  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 29-year-old white female, married to her husband, Ryan, and residing in the town of Jackson, Wyoming. She works as an Executive Administrative Assistant at a mid-sized financial services firm in downtown Jackson, with a yearly salary of $62,000. Her husband, Ryan, is a successful financial advisor, earning around $180,000 annually, contributing to their combined household income exceeding $200,000.\n\nBorn and raised in Wyoming, Alex is a US citizen and a high school graduate of Jackson Hole High School. She did not pursue higher education due to the high cost and her family's financial situation at the time. However, she has acquired various administrative certifications through online courses and professional training programs.\n\nAlex and Ryan own a 2,500 sq. ft. single-family home in the upscale neighborhood of Wilson, with a mortgage of $450,000 and a monthly payment of $2,800. They have two cars: a 2018 Toyota 4Runner for Alex and a 2020 Ford F-150 for Ryan.\n\nThe couple does not have any children yet but are planning to start a family soon. They have private health insurance through Ryan's employer, covering both of them with a monthly premium of $800.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex is concerned about the state's economy, particularly the impact of tourism on local infrastructure and the environment. She supports sustainable development and is interested in policies that promote eco-friendly practices. With her husband's financial expertise, they are also invested in the stock market and closely follow economic trends, making them keenly aware of the national economic situation.\n\nGiven their financial stability, Alex and Ryan are able to save around 20% of their income and contribute to a 401(k) retirement plan. They prioritize saving for their future family and plan to invest in their children's education.\n\nAlex's economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Jackson, particularly housing prices, and the need for more affordable options for young families. She also worries about the impact of inflation on their savings and investments. Politically, she leans conservative on fiscal issues but is more liberal on social and environmental matters."
