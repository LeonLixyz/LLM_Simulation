  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old White female, currently residing in a homeless shelter in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Oregon, Alex grew up in a middle-class family and was the first in her family to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Social Work from the University of Wyoming. Her late husband, whom she married at 19, was her high school sweetheart; they met while volunteering at a local animal shelter. He passed away two years ago due to a sudden illness.\n\nAlex speaks English fluently and has no known disabilities. She does not identify with any specific ethnicity. After her husband's passing, Alex struggled to maintain their apartment due to the loss of his income and her student loans. Despite her best efforts, she found herself homeless six months ago.\n\nCurrently, Alex works part-time as a social services coordinator at a local non-profit organization, earning approximately $25,000 per year. She is actively seeking full-time employment to get back on her feet and regain stability. Her economic concerns are centered around affordable housing, job security, and managing her student loan debt.\n\nAlex's experience with homelessness has made her passionate about advocating for affordable housing solutions and support services for vulnerable populations. She spends her free time volunteering at the shelter where she resides, helping others navigate the complexities of the social services system. Her educational background in social work has equipped her with a deep understanding of the systemic issues surrounding poverty and homelessness, influencing her political views and priorities.\n\nAssumptions made based on the metadata:\n\n- Ethnicity: Given the null value, it is assumed that Alex does not identify with a specific ethnicity, focusing instead on her racial identity as White.\n- Household Type: Since Alex is homeless and widowed, it is assumed that her household type is not applicable in the traditional sense, as she does not have a permanent residence or a family unit in the conventional definition."
