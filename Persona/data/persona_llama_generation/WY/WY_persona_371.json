  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 39-year-old White male who resides in Casper, Wyoming. Ryan was born in Wyoming and has lived there his entire life, which has deeply rooted him in the local culture and economy. He speaks English fluently and has no other language proficiency.\n\nRyan's educational background includes two years of college, where he studied business administration before dropping out due to personal reasons. This educational experience has provided him with foundational knowledge in business, but he lacks a degree, which slightly hampers his career advancement opportunities.\n\nRyan is currently employed as a retail sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, earning approximately $32,000 per year. This job aligns with his passion for the outdoors and allows him to be close to nature, which is a significant aspect of life in Wyoming.\n\nRyan is a widower, having lost his spouse three years ago due to illness. He lives with his parents, who own a modest single-family home in a suburban neighborhood in Casper. This living arrangement has been a significant support system for Ryan, especially after the loss of his spouse. His parents are both in their early sixties and are nearing retirement.\n\nAs a result of his spouse's passing, Ryan has had to adjust his financial situation significantly. He has some savings, but they are limited, and he relies heavily on his income from the retail job. He does not own a home and contributes to his parents' household expenses. Ryan's primary economic concerns include securing a better-paying job, rebuilding his savings, and eventually becoming financially independent.\n\nRyan's experience as a widower has also influenced his views on social and economic policies. He is particularly interested in policies that support widowers and their families, such as access to affordable healthcare and education. He is also concerned about the local economy and the impact of tourism on the community.\n\nIn terms of his daily life, Ryan is an avid outdoorsman and spends his free time hiking, fishing, and camping in the nearby mountains. He is also involved in local community events and volunteers at a local animal shelter. Despite the challenges he has faced, Ryan remains optimistic about his future and is committed to rebuilding his life and contributing to his community."
