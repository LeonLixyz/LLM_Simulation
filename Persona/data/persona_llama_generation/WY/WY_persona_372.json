  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 28-year-old white female, born to American parents in Guam, a US territory, but considers herself a Wyoming native after her family relocated to Cheyenne when she was a child. She currently lives with her parents in a suburban neighborhood due to her specific financial circumstances.\n\nAlex is married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan, whom she met during her junior year. They tied the knot two years ago and are currently saving up for their own home. Despite being married, Alex still resides with her parents due to the high cost of housing in the area and the desire to pay off some of their student loans before moving out.\n\nAlex holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed three years ago. Her degree led her to secure a job as an Environmental Consultant at a local firm, where she earns $48,000 per year. Her job involves assessing the environmental impact of construction projects and proposing sustainable solutions. Alex is proud of her work, as it aligns with her passion for preserving Wyoming's natural beauty.\n\nHer husband Ryan works as a part-time electrician, earning around $35,000 annually. Together, they have a combined income of $83,000, which they manage carefully to make ends meet, given their goal of saving for a down payment on a house and starting a family.\n\nAs a child living with her parents, Alex contributes $500 monthly to the household expenses, which helps her parents with their mortgage payments. Her parents, both retired school teachers, own a modest three-bedroom house with a small backyard. The household is supportive, with her parents often providing guidance on financial planning and offering to babysit once Alex and Ryan decide to have children.\n\nAlex's economic concerns revolve around affordable housing, access to quality education, and environmental conservation. She believes in investing in renewable energy sources and supports local initiatives that promote sustainable development. Her experiences living in Wyoming have instilled in her a deep appreciation for the state's natural resources and a desire to preserve them for future generations.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking in the nearby mountains, practicing yoga, and volunteering for local environmental causes. She is an avid reader, often devouring books on sustainable living and environmental policy. Alex is well-informed about local and national politics, frequently engaging in discussions with her family and friends about issues affecting her community."
