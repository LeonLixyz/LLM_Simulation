  "PERSONA": "A 27-year-old white male, living with his parents in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, which he obtained from the University of Wyoming. This individual is fluent in English, having spoken it as his primary language throughout his life. He is a non-veteran and has never been married. His parents own the home they all live in, a modest two-story house in a middle-class neighborhood. \n\nHe works part-time as a sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, earning approximately $25,000 per year. This role is not directly related to his field of study, but it allows him to stay in his hometown and support his parents while he figures out his long-term career goals. \n\nAs the youngest child, he has one older sister who has moved out and started her own family. This has led to him taking on more responsibilities at home, including helping with household chores and occasionally watching his sister's kids when they visit.\n\nGiven his current financial situation and living arrangement, his primary economic concerns include saving enough money to eventually move out and start his own life, possibly pursuing further education or a career more closely aligned with his degree. He also worries about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, especially as it pertains to housing and healthcare costs for his aging parents. Politically, he may be inclined to support policies that promote affordable housing, accessible education, and economic growth initiatives that could lead to better job opportunities in his area."
