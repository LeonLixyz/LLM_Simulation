  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Richard \"Dick\" Thompson, a retired mechanical engineer living in a modest suburban home in Casper, Wyoming. He has been married to his wife, Susan, a retired librarian, for 42 years. Born in Billings, Montana, Dick moved to Wyoming 25 years ago for a job opportunity at a local oil refinery. He has lived in the same house in Casper for the past 20 years.\n\nDick's educational background includes two years at Casper College, where he studied mechanical engineering, but he did not complete his degree due to financial constraints. He learned most of his trade through on-the-job training and vocational certifications. Before retiring five years ago, Dick worked for 35 years in the oil and gas industry, with his last position being a senior mechanical engineer at a local refinery.\n\nDick and his wife own their home, which they purchased in 2003 for $180,000. The house, now valued at around $280,000, has a mortgage of $120,000, with monthly payments of $800. Their combined annual income from pensions and retirement accounts is $65,000. They also receive $40,000 annually from Social Security benefits. Their primary economic concerns are healthcare costs, property taxes, and the impact of inflation on their fixed income.\n\nDick's primary responsibilities include managing the household budget, maintaining their home, and caring for Susan, who has mobility issues due to arthritis. He is also an avid outdoorsman and spends a lot of his free time fishing and hiking in the nearby mountains. Dick is a self-identified conservative and is concerned about the national debt, the impact of regulations on local businesses, and access to quality healthcare. He is a registered Republican and votes in local and national elections, often prioritizing candidates who share his views on fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention."
