  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Elena Garcia, a US-born Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity living in Casper, Wyoming. Elena resides with her parents in a modest, two-story family home in a working-class neighborhood near downtown Casper. Although she has never married, her family-oriented upbringing and close relationship with her parents are significant factors in her life. \n\nElena's educational background includes two years of community college, where she studied business administration but did not obtain a degree due to financial constraints and the need to support her family. This educational foundation has helped her secure a stable job as an administrative assistant at a local insurance firm, earning an annual salary of $38,500. \n\nAs a non-veteran and US citizen born in Wyoming, Elena feels a strong connection to her community and is invested in its economic well-being. She is proficient in English and does not speak Spanish at home, although she understands it, reflecting her family's cultural assimilation into American society. Elena's economic concerns include saving for her future, contributing to her family's household expenses, and navigating the challenges of living in a state with limited job opportunities and a relatively low cost of living.\n\nElena's daily commute to work is approximately 20 minutes, allowing her to maintain a work-life balance and participate in local community events during her free time. Her living situation with her parents enables her to allocate a portion of her income toward savings, retirement, and personal expenses, such as her car loan and phone bill. Despite not having a college degree, Elena's career aspirations involve professional growth and potentially pursuing higher education in the future to enhance her job prospects and increase her earning potential."
