  "PERSONA": "Emilio \"Milo\" Garcia is a 79-year-old Aztec American Indian and Alaska Native male, residing in the rural town of Lander, Wyoming, with his wife, Elena, and their youngest son, Jesse, who is 17 years old. Emilio was born in Wyoming and has lived there his entire life. He is the primary householder and has been married to Elena for 52 years.\n\nEmilio's educational background includes completing two years at Casper College, where he studied agriculture and animal husbandry, but he did not receive a degree. This educational foundation has served him well in his career as a ranch hand and later as a part-owner of a small, family-operated cattle ranch. Emilio's work experience spans over 40 years, with the last 20 years spent working on the family ranch. His income is approximately $45,000 per year, supplemented by his wife's part-time work as a school librarian, which brings in an additional $18,000 annually.\n\nThe Garcias own their home, a modest, three-bedroom ranch-style house on 10 acres of land, which they purchased in 1985 for $120,000. The current value of their property is around $280,000. Emilio and Elena have three children, with their eldest son, Michael, living in Cheyenne with his family, and their middle child, Emily, attending the University of Wyoming in Laramie.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Emilio's economic concerns focus on maintaining the family ranch, ensuring Jesse's college education is affordable, and managing the household expenses on their fixed income. Emilio is fluent in English, having grown up speaking it as his primary language, and has no known proficiency in his ancestral Aztec language. Despite this, he maintains strong cultural ties to his heritage and participates in local Native American community events.\n\nEmilio's political views are shaped by his experiences as a rancher and a member of the Native American community. He prioritizes issues related to land use, water rights, and education, particularly as they affect rural communities and indigenous peoples. Emilio and Elena are active in local politics, often attending town hall meetings and participating in discussions on issues that impact their community and way of life."
