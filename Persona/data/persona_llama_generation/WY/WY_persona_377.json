  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 29-year-old white female, is the primary householder of a married-couple household without children. She resides in the small town of Lander, Wyoming, in a modest, single-family home that she and her husband, James, own with a mortgage. Emily was born in Wyoming and has lived there her entire life, which has instilled in her a strong sense of community and an appreciation for the outdoors.\n\nEmily's highest level of education is 11th grade, which she completed at Lander Valley High School. Due to family financial constraints and a desire to enter the workforce early, she did not pursue a high school diploma or further education. Her decision was also influenced by her goal of starting her own business, which she felt could be learned through hands-on experience and vocational training.\n\nProfessionally, Emily works as a retail sales associate at a local outdoor gear store in Lander, earning approximately $28,000 per year. Her job allows her to stay connected to her community and support local tourism. James, her husband, works as a mechanic at a nearby garage, earning around $40,000 annually. Their combined income allows them to maintain a modest lifestyle and make timely mortgage payments on their home.\n\nEmily's primary concerns economically are managing their household budget, saving for the future (including retirement and potential children), and navigating the complexities of healthcare insurance. Given her experience working in retail and her husband's job as a mechanic, Emily is particularly interested in policies that support small businesses, improve access to affordable healthcare, and promote economic development in rural areas like hers.\n\nAs a non-veteran and with no immediate family members in the military, Emily's views on veterans' affairs are shaped by her respect for those who serve and a general support for policies that ensure their welfare and reintegration into civilian life. However, her immediate economic concerns and those of her community take precedence in her political views.\n\nEmily speaks only English and does so fluently, having been born and raised in the United States. Her cultural background is typical of the region, with a strong emphasis on self-reliance, community, and outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing. These values influence her political and economic views, favoring policies that support local communities, environmental conservation, and individual freedoms."
