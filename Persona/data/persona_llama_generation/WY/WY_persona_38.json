  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson, an 87-year-old male, living alone in a single-family home in the town of Cody, Wyoming. Born in Wisconsin but having lived in Wyoming for over 30 years, Harold is a lifelong US citizen with English as his only language, which he speaks fluently. He holds a Bachelor's degree in History from the University of Wisconsin, which he earned in 1959. Harold has been married for 58 years to his wife, Margaret, who lives in a nearby assisted living facility due to her advanced Alzheimer's diagnosis; they have no children. \n\nAs a retiree, Harold is no longer in the labor force. Before retiring at 65, he worked as a high school history teacher for 30 years in the local school district. His pension, combined with his wife's Social Security benefits and their investments, provide them with an annual household income of $92,500. Harold's health insurance is covered through Medicare, supplemented by a private plan. \n\nHarold's primary economic concerns are the rising costs of his wife's care and the potential impact of changes in healthcare policies on their coverage and expenses. He also worries about the long-term sustainability of his pension and the effects of inflation on his fixed income. Despite these concerns, Harold feels relatively secure in his financial situation, having paid off the mortgage on his home and owning it outright. His home, valued at $320,000, is a significant asset, though Harold has no intention of selling it, as it holds sentimental value and is close to his wife's care facility."
