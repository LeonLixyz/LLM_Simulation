  "PERSONA": "Meet Evelyn Thompson, a 68-year-old Black or African American woman, who has been a resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming, for the past 20 years. She is married to her husband, Michael, a 70-year-old retired mechanic, and they have been together for 42 years. Evelyn holds a Bachelor's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in 1978. After graduating, she worked as a high school English teacher for 25 years before retiring in 2003. \n\nEvelyn and her husband own a modest single-family home in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, which they purchased in 1995 for $120,000. The current value of their home is around $250,000. They have two children, both of whom have moved out of the house and are financially independent. Their son, David, is a 40-year-old software engineer living in Denver, Colorado, and their daughter, Sarah, is a 38-year-old pediatrician in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nAs a retiree, Evelyn's primary source of income is her pension from the Wyoming State Retirement System, which provides her with a monthly income of $3,200. Her husband also receives a monthly pension of $2,500 from his previous employer. Their combined annual household income is around $70,000. Evelyn is concerned about the rising cost of healthcare and the impact of inflation on their fixed income. She is also worried about the lack of diversity and cultural opportunities in Cheyenne, which she feels is limited compared to other parts of the country.\n\nEvelyn is a registered Democrat and is actively involved in local politics. She volunteers at the Cheyenne Democratic Party headquarters and participates in local campaigns that focus on education and healthcare. She is fluent in English and has a strong command of the language, which she attributes to her education and teaching background.\n\nAssumptions: \n- Based on Evelyn's age, education, and occupation, it is reasonable to assume that she is a moderate Democrat with a strong interest in education and healthcare policy.\n- Given her household income and expenses, it is likely that Evelyn is concerned about economic security and the impact of policy decisions on her retirement savings.\n- As a resident of Wyoming, Evelyn may have a unique perspective on issues related to rural development, natural resources, and environmental policy."
