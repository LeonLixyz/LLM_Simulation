  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 27-year-old white female living in a shared house in Laramie, Wyoming. She is a non-relative housemate, sharing the house with two other individuals she met through mutual friends. Alex has never been married and has no dependents. She is a U.S. citizen, born in Idaho but currently resides in Wyoming for work.\n\nAssuming her household type based on her non-relative housemate status and location in a college town, Alex likely lives in a rented, shared house near the University of Wyoming, close to downtown Laramie. The house is a modest, three-bedroom, one-bathroom property with a small yard.\n\nAlex graduated from high school in Idaho and moved to Wyoming for better job opportunities. She works as a server at a local restaurant in downtown Laramie, earning around $25,000 per year. Her English proficiency is excellent, and she communicates solely in English.\n\nAs a high school graduate, Alex's career trajectory has been limited to service industry jobs. She has been working at the restaurant for about two years and is considering furthering her education to improve her job prospects. However, her current financial situation makes it challenging to pursue higher education.\n\nAlex's economic concerns include affording health insurance, saving for the future, and potentially going back to school. She is interested in local politics, particularly policies affecting small businesses and the service industry, as they directly impact her livelihood. Her experiences as a server have made her aware of the challenges faced by low-wage workers in Wyoming, and she is likely to support policies that address these issues."
