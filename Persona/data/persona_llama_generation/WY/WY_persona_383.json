  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 38-year-old male of mixed White and American Indian descent, living in the state of Wyoming. Ethan is a non-veteran who was born in the United States, specifically in the state of Arizona, but has resided in Wyoming for the past eight years. He is fluent in English, speaking it well, and has no other language proficiency.\n\nEthan holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science, which he obtained from the University of Wyoming. His educational background has been instrumental in securing a job as an Environmental Consultant at a local firm in Cheyenne, the state capital, where he works on projects related to sustainable land use and conservation. His annual income is approximately $62,000.\n\nEthan is married to his wife, Sarah, whom he met while attending college. They do not have any children but are considering starting a family soon. Ethan's marital status is classified as \"now married, except separated,\" indicating that they have not experienced any significant marital disruptions. As a married couple, they share a two-bedroom apartment in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, for which they pay $1,200 per month in rent.\n\nGiven his role as an Environmental Consultant, Ethan is deeply concerned about the impact of economic policies on the environment and natural resources. He is particularly interested in policies related to renewable energy, conservation, and sustainable land use. His economic priorities include affordable healthcare, access to quality education, and job security.\n\nEthan's household situation is unique in that he lives with his wife and his younger brother, who is a student at the local community college. His brother's presence in the household is the reason for his \"Other Relative of Householder\" classification. This living arrangement allows them to split household expenses and provide mutual support.\n\nIn terms of economic situation, Ethan's household income is considered middle-class, but they have to manage their expenses carefully to make ends meet. They are not homeowners yet, but they aspire to purchase a house in the near future, which would require them to navigate the complexities of the housing market and mortgage financing.\n\nOverall, Ethan's demographic characteristics, educational background, and economic situation shape his views on policy issues, with a strong emphasis on environmental sustainability, economic security, and access to quality education and healthcare."
