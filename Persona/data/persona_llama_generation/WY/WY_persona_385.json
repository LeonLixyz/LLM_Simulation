  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Elena Garc\u00eda, a 62-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States but originally from New Mexico. She currently resides in Casper, Wyoming, with her husband, Jes\u00fas, in a cozy, two-bedroom house they've rented for the past five years. Ana Elena lives with her husband and her 25-year-old niece, Sofia, who is a college student at Casper College. Sofia's parents, Ana Elena's sister and brother-in-law, are going through a divorce, so Ana Elena and Jes\u00fas have taken Sofia in to provide a stable environment.\n\nAna Elena is a proud holder of an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education from Casper College, which she earned in her mid-30s after raising her two children. She has worked as a preschool teacher at a local daycare center for over 15 years, earning an annual income of $43,000. Jes\u00fas, her husband, is a retired mechanic who now works part-time as a handyman, bringing in an additional $20,000 per year. Their combined income allows them to maintain a modest lifestyle, but they are careful with their expenses, especially since they're supporting Sofia's education.\n\nAna Elena and Jes\u00fas have two grown children who live out of state. Their son, Carlos, is a high school teacher in Denver, Colorado, and their daughter, Maria, is a nurse in Phoenix, Arizona. Both children are married with young kids, and Ana Elena loves being a grandmother to her four grandchildren.\n\nAs a homeowner in the past, Ana Elena and Jes\u00fas sold their house after their children moved out to downsize and reduce expenses. They now rent a house in a quiet neighborhood near the daycare center where Ana Elena works. Their monthly rent is $1,200, which is relatively affordable in Casper.\n\nAna Elena's economic concerns center around saving for retirement, ensuring Sofia's education is funded, and maintaining their current standard of living. She is keenly interested in local and national policies affecting education, healthcare, and social security, as these directly impact her family's well-being and her own retirement plans. Despite not being a veteran herself, Ana Elena's brother is a veteran, and she advocates for policies supporting veterans' benefits and services.\n\nAna Elena is fluent in English, having grown up in the United States, but she still celebrates her Mexican heritage by cooking traditional meals and participating in local cultural events. She and Jes\u00fas are active members of their community, volunteering at the local food bank and participating in neighborhood potlucks."
