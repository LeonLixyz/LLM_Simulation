  "PERSONA": "A 57-year-old divorced female, born in the state of Oregon, but currently residing in a small town in Wyoming, where she lives with her aging parents due to financial necessity. She is a white, non-Hispanic, US-born citizen who speaks English fluently.\n\nEducationally, she attended community college for two years, studying business administration but did not complete her degree due to financial constraints. This educational background has limited her job opportunities, and she currently works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance agency, earning approximately $28,000 per year.\n\nAs a result of her modest income and past financial struggles following her divorce, she rents a small room in her parents' home, which is located in a relatively low-income neighborhood in a rural area of Wyoming. Her parents, both in their early seventies, own the home but are on a fixed income, relying on social security benefits and a small pension. This living arrangement allows her to contribute financially to the household while also providing care for her aging parents.\n\nAs a single, middle-aged woman with limited financial resources and significant family responsibilities, her primary economic concerns include access to affordable healthcare, job security, and the rising cost of living in rural areas. She worries about the impact of economic downturns on her job, her ability to support herself and her parents, and the strain on local social services that her family might need to rely on.\n\nAssumptions made based on missing metadata points include:\n\n* Ethnicity is assumed as non-Hispanic based on the absence of any indication of Hispanic origin and the stated race as White.\n* HOUSEHOLD_TYPE is assumed as a multi-generational household given the living arrangement described.\n* Marital status as divorced implies she has no spouse to contribute to household income or share family responsibilities."
