  "PERSONA": "Carlos Hernandez, a 68-year-old male, is the primary householder of a married-couple household without kids in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Although listed as \"Never married\" due to a technicality, Carlos has been in a long-term, committed relationship with his partner, Juan, for over 20 years. They chose not to get formally married due to personal reasons and the fact that Wyoming did not recognize same-sex marriage until 2014. Carlos identifies as \"Some Other Race\" due to his mixed Hispanic and Native American heritage, but does not identify with a specific ethnicity.\n\nCarlos was born in Wyoming and has lived in the state his entire life. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 1978. Although he was not in the labor force at the time of data collection, Carlos had a fulfilling career as a park ranger for over 25 years, working for the US National Park Service. He retired from his position in 2013.\n\nCarlos and his partner, Juan, own their home in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne. Their house, valued at around $250,000, was purchased in 2005 for $180,000. They have a mortgage with a monthly payment of around $1,200. Carlos's annual income is around $42,000, which comes from his retirement pension and some investments. Juan, who is still working part-time as a freelance writer, contributes an additional $15,000 to their household income.\n\nCarlos has public health insurance coverage through Medicare and a supplemental plan. His primary economic concerns include maintaining a comfortable retirement, ensuring access to quality healthcare, and addressing the rising costs of living in Wyoming. As someone who has spent his career working in environmental conservation, Carlos is also passionate about protecting Wyoming's natural resources and preserving its unique wildlife."
