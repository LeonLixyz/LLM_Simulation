  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 28-year-old White female, born in Boise, Idaho, but currently residing in Casper, Wyoming. She is a high school graduate with a strong proficiency in English, having spoken it as her primary language since birth. As the primary householder, Alex lives alone in a rented, one-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood near downtown Casper.\n\nAssuming a high school diploma is the highest level of education completed, Alex likely did not pursue higher education due to financial constraints or personal preference. She works as a dental assistant at a local clinic, earning approximately $38,000 per year. This income is modest but sufficient for her single lifestyle, allowing her to cover rent ($900/month), utilities, and basic living expenses while saving a small portion for future goals, such as homeownership or further education.\n\nAs a non-veteran and never married, Alex's life revolves around her career, friendships, and community involvement. She spends her free time volunteering at a local animal shelter and participating in outdoor activities like hiking and rock climbing, taking advantage of Wyoming's vast natural beauty. Her economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, managing student loan debt from a short-lived community college stint, and navigating the rising costs of healthcare as a self-insured individual.\n\nAlex's living situation and financial priorities might lead her to be interested in local economic development initiatives, affordable housing policies, and access to quality, affordable healthcare. Her experience as a single female without kids in a relatively conservative state like Wyoming may also influence her views on women's rights, education, and social welfare programs."
