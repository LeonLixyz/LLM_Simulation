  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old female who identifies as White and Black or African American, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She shares a home with her parents in a suburban neighborhood, having moved back in after completing her Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming. \n\nAssuming the null \"HOUSEHOLD_TYPE\" indicates a traditional nuclear family setup given her living situation, Alex's parents are likely in their mid-to-late 40s, with her father working as a manager at a local manufacturing plant and her mother as a part-time teacher at a nearby high school. Her parents own their home, having purchased it over a decade ago, which currently holds a moderate value of around $280,000 due to Cheyenne's relatively stable housing market.\n\nMarried to her high school sweetheart, Jake, who is also 22 and a veteran of the US Army, having served for four years before being honorably discharged. Jake currently works as an apprentice electrician, aiming to start his own business in the near future. The couple met in their junior year of high school and got married right after Alex's graduation from college, with plans to save for a home of their own.\n\nAlex is a veteran of the US Army Reserve, having enlisted during her college years to help fund her education and gain valuable skills. She served for six years, including two years of active duty, and was honorably discharged with the rank of Sergeant. Her military experience has given her a strong sense of discipline and responsibility, which she applies to her current role as a part-time financial analyst at a local bank.\n\nGiven her educational background and experience, Alex's annual income is around $45,000, with Jake contributing an additional $35,000 from his apprenticeship. They are currently saving for a down payment on a house, aiming to utilize a VA loan due to Jake's veteran status. Their combined income and savings strategy places them in a relatively stable financial position, though they are cautious about the future, particularly concerning healthcare costs and job security.\n\nTheir economic concerns include affordable housing, access to quality education, and job opportunities that match their skills. Politically, Alex and her family tend to lean conservative on fiscal issues but are more liberal on social matters, reflecting the diverse views often found in Wyoming's smaller cities."
