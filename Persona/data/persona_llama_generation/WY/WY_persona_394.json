  "PERSONA": "Meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 62-year-old white female living in a single-family home in the suburbs of Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Alex resides alone, having never been married and without any children. She is a proud veteran, having served six years in the United States Air Force as a logistics specialist, from which she was honorably discharged with the rank of staff sergeant.\n\nBorn in Casper, Wyoming, Alex grew up in a middle-class family and was raised with a strong emphasis on education. She holds a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which she completed after her military service. This educational background led her to a successful career in management, working for over two decades in the private sector, primarily in the energy industry, which is prevalent in Wyoming. Currently, Alex works as a senior operations manager for a mid-sized oil and gas company, earning an annual income of $83,000.\n\nAlex is a homeowner, having purchased her current residence in 2005. Her home, valued at approximately $280,000, is a modest three-bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood, reflecting her preference for a peaceful, low-maintenance lifestyle. Her mortgage payments, along with utility bills and property taxes, constitute a significant portion of her monthly expenses.\n\nGiven her background and current situation, Alex's economic concerns revolve around retirement security and healthcare costs. With her income being a mix of salary and investments, she is keenly interested in policies that affect retirement savings, such as changes to Social Security and Medicare. As a veteran, she also closely follows policies related to veterans' healthcare and benefits. Living in a state heavily reliant on the energy sector, Alex is also concerned about the economic impact of environmental policies on her industry and community.\n\nDespite these concerns, Alex feels financially stable and is committed to her community. She volunteers at local veterans' organizations and supports local businesses, reflecting her strong sense of community and civic responsibility. Her political views are moderate, leaning towards conservative on fiscal issues but liberal on social matters, particularly those affecting veterans and women's rights."
