  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 29-year-old white female, is a non-relative housemate in a shared living arrangement in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her husband, Ryan, whom she met while working as a server at a local restaurant in college. The couple decided to move to Cheyenne for Ryan's job as a software engineer at a local tech firm. Alex has a non-traditional household setup, sharing a three-bedroom house with two other friends, also in their late 20s, who work in the service industry.\n\nAlex was born in Colorado but has lived in Wyoming for the past five years. She attended Laramie County Community College for two years, studying business administration, but did not complete her degree due to financial constraints and the need to work full-time. Currently, Alex works as a part-time administrative assistant at a small marketing firm, earning $35,000 annually, and supplements her income by freelancing as a social media manager for local businesses.\n\nThe couple rents a house in a moderately priced neighborhood, paying $1,200 per month, which is slightly above the average rent in Cheyenne. They do not have children but are planning to start a family in the next few years. Alex is concerned about affordable childcare options and access to quality healthcare in Wyoming, which influences her views on local and national policies.\n\nAlex's economic concerns revolve around student loan debt, which she accumulated during her time in college, and the rising cost of living in Cheyenne. She is interested in policies that address affordable housing, education, and workforce development, as she believes these issues directly impact her life and the lives of her friends and community.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking in the nearby mountains, practicing yoga, and volunteering at a local animal shelter. She values community involvement and often participates in local events, such as farmers' markets and concerts. Alex's social circle consists of friends from work, her husband's colleagues, and acquaintances from the local service industry.\n\nAssumptions made based on missing values:\n\n* Ethnicity: Based on Alex's birthplace and race, it is assumed that she is non-Hispanic.\n* HOUSEHOLD_TYPE: Given Alex's marital status and living arrangement, it is assumed that she lives in a shared household with non-relatives, which is a common setup for young adults in similar economic situations."
