  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, an 19-year-old male, born in Idaho, but currently residing in Laramie, Wyoming, as the primary householder of his single-person household. Ethan is a White, non-Hispanic male, with no children, and has never been married. He is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently. \n\nEthan graduated from high school with a diploma, having attended Laramie High School. After graduating, he decided to pursue a career in the trades, specifically as an apprentice electrician at a local electrical contracting firm, where he earns approximately $35,000 annually. He works full-time, which leaves him with limited time for further education but allows him to support himself financially.\n\nAs the primary householder, Ethan rents a modest, one-bedroom apartment in a relatively affordable neighborhood in Laramie, with a monthly rent of around $800. He shares no financial responsibilities with anyone else and is solely responsible for his living expenses.\n\nEthan's primary economic concerns include managing his student loan debt from a short stint at a local community college and saving for potential future educational pursuits. He also hopes to one day own his own home but feels that the current housing market in Laramie is challenging for first-time buyers. Ethan's economic priorities are focused on financial stability, saving for the future, and possibly advancing his career through vocational training or certifications.\n\nAssumptions made based on the provided metadata include Ethan's non-Hispanic ethnicity due to the null value for ethnicity, and his specific location within Wyoming being Laramie, a college town with a relatively affordable cost of living."
