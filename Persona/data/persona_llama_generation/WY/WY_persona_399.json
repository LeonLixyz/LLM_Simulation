  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson is a 22-year-old White female, born and raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a recent college graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, where she graduated with a 3.5 GPA. Emily's marital status is listed as widowed due to her husband's passing in a tragic accident during her junior year of college; they had been married for about a year after meeting in high school. Despite this life-altering event, Emily has continued to live with her supportive parents in their family home, a single-story, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, to help with her emotional and financial recovery. \n\nAs the child of a retired school teacher and a part-time librarian, Emily has grown up in a household valuing education and community involvement. Her parents have been instrumental in her decision to pursue higher education, and their influence has instilled in her a strong interest in environmental conservation and community development. \n\nEmily's current job is as an entry-level environmental analyst at a local non-profit organization focused on Wyoming's wildlife conservation. She earns a modest income of $38,000 per year, which, although not high, is sufficient for her current living situation with her parents. Her economic concerns primarily revolve around saving for graduate school, paying off her student loans, and eventually moving out to start her own life. \n\nAs a Wyoming native, Emily is deeply connected to the state's natural beauty and outdoor lifestyle, often spending her free time hiking and volunteering for local environmental initiatives. Her economic priorities include affordable education, sustainable development, and job opportunities that align with her environmental passions. Emily's experience as a young widow and her background in environmental science have shaped her perspectives on economic and political issues, particularly in the context of her home state's unique challenges and opportunities."
