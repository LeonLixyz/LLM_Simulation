  "PERSONA": "Margaret Thompson, a 68-year-old White female, is a widow living in a shared residence with a non-relative housemate in a modest neighborhood in Casper, Wyoming. Born in Illinois, she has lived in Wyoming for over a decade after moving for her late husband's job. Margaret holds a high school diploma and attended community college for two years but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. She is fluent in English and has no proficiency in any other language.\n\nMargaret is not currently in the labor force and has been out of the workforce for several years. Her late husband was the primary breadwinner, and she managed the household and raised their two children, who are now grown and living independently. Margaret's lack of a pension or significant retirement savings, combined with the loss of her husband's income, has resulted in a constrained financial situation, with an annual income of $8,500, primarily from Social Security benefits.\n\nMargaret is a US citizen by birth and has always been interested in local politics, although her involvement has been limited to voting in local and national elections. Her economic concerns revolve around access to affordable healthcare, as she does not have health insurance coverage and relies on community clinics and non-profit organizations for medical care. The rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly housing and utilities, also weighs heavily on her mind.\n\nMargaret's living situation is a shared, two-bedroom apartment in a relatively affordable neighborhood, with a monthly rent of $600. She relies on her housemate, a retired friend, for companionship and occasional financial support. Her daily life is quiet, with most days spent reading, volunteering at a local food bank, and managing her limited budget to ensure she can afford basic necessities. Margaret's economic and political views are shaped by her experiences as a widow living on a fixed income, with a strong desire for policies that support affordable healthcare, housing, and social services for seniors and low-income individuals."
