  "PERSONA": "Meet Elena Garc\u00eda, an 87-year-old, US-born, white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a Spanish-speaking, high school graduate who speaks English well. As the primary householder, Elena resides in a single-family home she owns, located in a quiet suburban neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. \n\nElena has been married to her husband, 90-year-old John, for 62 years, and they have two adult children, both of whom have moved out of the house. Her daughter, Maria, lives in Denver, Colorado, with her husband and two kids, while her son, Michael, resides in Phoenix, Arizona, with his wife and one child. Elena's household income is approximately $50,000 per year, mostly derived from her husband's pension and their combined social security benefits. Elena also earns a small income from part-time work as a babysitter for a local family with two young children.\n\nElena's educational background as a high school graduate has significantly influenced her career trajectory. After graduating, she worked as a secretary for a local insurance company for over 20 years. Upon retirement, she took up babysitting to stay engaged and supplement her household income. Her experience as a working mother and homemaker has shaped her economic concerns, prioritizing affordable healthcare, social security, and education. \n\nAs a homeowner, Elena is concerned about rising property taxes and the increasing cost of living in Cheyenne. Her family responsibilities include caring for her husband, who has mobility issues, and occasionally helping her children with their families. Her economic priorities include ensuring a stable financial future for her family, maintaining her independence, and contributing to her community through volunteer work at a local senior center.\n\nElena's language preference is Spanish, but she speaks English well, which has been beneficial in her interactions with the local community and her part-time job. Her US citizenship and birth in a different state (California) have given her a unique perspective on the country's cultural and economic diversity. Elena's specific geographic location in Wyoming, a state with a relatively low cost of living and a strong sense of community, influences her economic views and priorities, particularly regarding state and federal policies on healthcare, education, and senior care.\n\nAssumptions: \n- Elena's husband's pension is assumed to be the primary source of income, given her part-time work as a babysitter.\n- Her birthplace is assumed to be California, given her US birth and different state of birth detail."
