  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 79-year-old White female, resides in a homeless shelter in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Montana, Emily has been a US citizen her entire life and speaks only English, which she speaks well. She never married after her husband's passing 10 years ago, and due to financial constraints and lack of support, Emily found herself without a home.\n\nEmily's highest level of education is 11th grade, as she had to drop out of high school to support her family. This limited her job opportunities, and she worked as a waitress for most of her life, earning around $25,000 per year before she had to stop working due to health issues.\n\nAs a widow, Emily relies on a monthly Social Security benefit of $1,200 and occasional help from local charities to get by. Her economic concerns are primarily centered around accessing affordable healthcare and finding stable housing. Emily's living situation makes her particularly concerned about policy issues related to affordable housing, healthcare for low-income individuals, and social security benefits.\n\nEmily's experience with the healthcare system is limited due to the costs, but she does receive some medical assistance through a local clinic. Her social connections are mostly limited to the people she meets at the homeless shelter, and she occasionally visits her sister who lives in a nearby town.\n\nEmily's lack of economic stability and reliance on government assistance make her particularly sensitive to changes in social welfare policies and programs that support low-income individuals and the homeless."
