  "PERSONA": "John Thompson, a 68-year-old white male, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder of a married-couple household without kids, but is currently separated from his spouse. Born in Colorado, John moved to Wyoming for its vast outdoor spaces and lower cost of living, which suits his semi-retired lifestyle. As a US-born citizen, John speaks English fluently and has no known ethnicity. \n\nJohn's educational background includes attending a local community college in Colorado, where he pursued an associate's degree in business administration but did not graduate due to work commitments. This educational foundation has served him well in his career as an office manager for a small insurance firm in downtown Cheyenne, a position he has held for the past 15 years. His annual income is approximately $55,000, with some fluctuations based on the company's performance.\n\nJohn and his spouse, although separated, jointly own a modest, two-bedroom home in a middle-class neighborhood near the outskirts of Cheyenne, with a mortgage of around $800 per month. The house, valued at about $220,000, is their primary asset and a source of financial stability. John's economic concerns include maintaining his health insurance coverage post-retirement and ensuring his savings can support his living expenses without relying on his spouse's income.\n\nJohn's separation from his spouse has led to a reevaluation of his financial priorities, focusing more on saving for his retirement and reducing unnecessary expenses. Despite the separation, John values the stability of his long-term marriage and hopes for reconciliation. John's political views are influenced by his conservative upbringing and his experiences as a small business employee, prioritizing economic stability, lower taxes, and limited government intervention in business."
