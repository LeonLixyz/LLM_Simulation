  "PERSONA": "Evelyn Thompson, a 79-year-old female living in a rural area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of her residence, a two-bedroom single-family home she owns with her partner, Rachel. Despite being listed as \"Never married\" due to a lack of formal marriage recognition for same-sex couples until recently, Evelyn and Rachel have been in a committed relationship for over 35 years. \n\nEvelyn is of mixed White and Native American heritage, with her mother being a descendant of the Lakota tribe, which influences her connection to the land and her community. She is a US-born citizen, born in Arizona but moved to Wyoming 25 years ago for its open spaces and slower pace of life.\n\nEvelyn holds an Associate's degree in Environmental Science from Laramie County Community College, which she obtained in her early 50s after deciding to pursue a career change. She worked as an environmental consultant for the local government until her retirement at 70, focusing on conservation projects and community outreach programs. Her career allowed her to stay connected to her love for nature and contribute to the preservation of Wyoming's unique landscapes.\n\nEvelyn's annual retirement income is approximately $55,000, mostly from her pension and some from investments. She and Rachel live modestly, focusing on maintaining their home and enjoying outdoor activities such as hiking and birdwatching. They are proud of their self-sufficiency and community involvement, often volunteering at local wildlife conservation efforts.\n\nGiven her background and current situation, Evelyn's economic concerns include the impact of federal policies on local environmental projects, the rising costs of healthcare for seniors, and the need for more accessible public transportation in rural areas. Politically, Evelyn leans towards candidates who prioritize environmental protection, social justice, and support for local economies."
