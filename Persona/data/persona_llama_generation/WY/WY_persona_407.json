  "PERSONA": "The individual is a 57-year-old White male named Jack, who resides in Cheyenne, the capital city of Wyoming. He is the primary householder of his household and has been married for over 10 years, although he and his wife have been separated for the past two years due to irreconcilable differences. They have no children together, and Jack's wife currently resides in a different part of the state. \n\nJack was born in Wyoming and has lived there his entire life, with the exception of a brief period when he attended community college in Colorado, where he pursued an associate's degree in automotive repair but did not complete it. He has always spoken English as his primary language and is fluent in it.\n\nProfessionally, Jack works as a mechanic at a local car dealership, earning a steady income of $52,000 per year. He has been with the same employer for over 15 years and has built a reputation as a reliable and skilled mechanic. Jack rents a modest two-bedroom apartment in a working-class neighborhood of Cheyenne, paying $800 per month in rent.\n\nGiven his economic situation, Jack's primary concerns revolve around job security and the rising cost of living in Wyoming. He is particularly worried about the impact of automation on his job and the increasing costs of healthcare. Jack is also concerned about the state's economic diversification, as he believes that the reliance on the energy industry makes the local economy vulnerable to fluctuations in global markets.\n\nDespite these concerns, Jack feels a strong sense of loyalty to his community and is committed to contributing to the local economy. He actively participates in local events and is a member of the Cheyenne Downtown Rotary Club, where he engages in discussions about community development and economic growth. Jack's experiences and concerns are shaped by his roots in Wyoming and his desire to see the state prosper while maintaining its unique character."
