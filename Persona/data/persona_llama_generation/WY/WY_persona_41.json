  "PERSONA": "A 38-year-old white female, who was born in the United States but in a different state from her current residence in Wyoming. She is a naturalized citizen, speaks English well, and her primary language at home is Polish, reflecting her \"Other Indo-European languages\" background. She is the primary householder of a single female household without kids, and is currently married, although her husband may be away for work or travel. She is not a veteran.\n\nShe holds a Bachelor's degree in Hospitality Management, which she earned from a local college in Wyoming after moving to the state for its natural beauty and outdoor lifestyle. This degree has served her well in her career as a head chef at a mid-range restaurant in downtown Cheyenne. Her annual income is $62,500, which places her in a comfortable middle-class position, allowing her to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment in a suburban neighborhood with a mix of old and new homes.\n\nShe has private health insurance through her employer, which she values highly due to a history of minor health issues that require regular check-ups. Her economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, as she dreams of owning her own home in the near future, and managing the increasing costs of living in a state with a growing economy and rising housing prices.\n\nHer specific job title and sector place her in a unique position where she witnesses firsthand the economic fluctuations in the tourism industry, which is a significant contributor to Wyoming's economy. This experience shapes her economic views, making her supportive of policies that promote local business growth and sustainable tourism practices."
