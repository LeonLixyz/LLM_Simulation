  "PERSONA": "John Thompson, a 49-year-old White male, resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with his long-term partner, whom he considers his spouse, despite not being legally married. Born in Portland, Oregon, John moved to Wyoming for its natural beauty and lower cost of living. \n\nAssuming John's household type is a domestic partnership due to the lack of information and his marital status as \"Never married\" but living with his spouse, his household consists of his partner, Alex, who works as a freelance writer, and their 10-year-old son from a previous relationship of Alex's.\n\nJohn's highest level of education is an associate's degree in automotive repair from a community college in Oregon. He works as a service manager at a local car dealership in Cheyenne, earning approximately $62,000 per year. This income, combined with Alex's variable freelance income (averaging around $40,000 annually), allows them to maintain a comfortable lifestyle in a modest, two-bedroom house they purchased 10 years ago for $180,000. Their current mortgage is $1,200 per month, and they have about $80,000 in equity.\n\nJohn is fluent in English and has no known disabilities. He is a non-veteran and has never served in the military. John's economic concerns include saving for his son's education and ensuring they have a secure financial future, particularly in retirement, given the fluctuations in Alex's income. He is keenly interested in local economic policies that support small businesses and the automotive industry, as well as initiatives that promote education and job security.\n\nJohn's family situation and economic responsibilities influence his political views, prioritizing policies that support families and the middle class. He is particularly interested in healthcare policies, given the challenges they faced when Alex was between freelance projects without health insurance. John's experiences living in a different state before moving to Wyoming also make him consider the impact of migration and interstate economic policies on local communities."
