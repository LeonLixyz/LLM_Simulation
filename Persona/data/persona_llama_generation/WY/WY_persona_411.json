  "PERSONA": "Meet Eduardo 'Ed' Ramirez, a 62-year-old male, who identifies as \"Some Other Race,\" specifically of Filipino descent, though he has not specified his ethnicity. Ed is the primary householder of a married-couple household without children, residing in a modest, single-family home in the suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming. He has been married to his wife, Karen, for over 30 years, and they have no children together.\n\nEd was born in California but moved to Wyoming over two decades ago for work. He is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. Ed's primary language is English, which he speaks fluently, having graduated from a California high school. He did not pursue higher education, instead opting for vocational training in automotive repair.\n\nEd works as a service manager at a local car dealership in Cheyenne, earning an annual salary of $55,000. His wife, Karen, is a part-time librarian at a nearby elementary school, bringing in an additional $20,000 per year. They own their home, which is valued at $240,000, with a mortgage of $120,000. Their household income is $75,000 per year.\n\nTheir economic concerns include saving for retirement, managing healthcare costs, and maintaining a comfortable lifestyle in their golden years. Ed is worried about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing property taxes and healthcare expenses. He is also concerned about the economic future of his community, as the coal industry, which once drove the local economy, continues to decline.\n\nEd's educational background and career trajectory have significantly influenced his economic views. As a high school graduate with vocational training, he values practical skills and apprenticeships. He believes that the government should invest more in vocational education and job training programs to support local industries.\n\nEd's family structure and responsibilities also shape his economic priorities. As a married couple without children, they have more disposable income, which they use to travel and support local businesses. However, they are also concerned about their retirement security and rely on their combined income to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Ed is aware of the state's economic challenges, including the decline of the coal industry and the need for diversification. He supports local initiatives to promote tourism and renewable energy, believing that these sectors can drive economic growth and create new job opportunities.\n\nEd's demographic characteristics, including his age, education, and economic situation, influence his political views. He is likely to prioritize policies that support local economic development, vocational education, and retirement security. His experiences as a married couple without children and a resident of Wyoming also shape his perspectives on issues like taxation, healthcare, and energy policy."
