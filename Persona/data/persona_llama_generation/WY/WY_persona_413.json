  "PERSONA": "Meet 57-year-old Ryan Thompson, a lifelong resident of Casper, Wyoming, the second-largest city in the state. As a single male without children, Ryan is the primary householder of his own home, a modest two-bedroom house in a quiet suburban neighborhood. He has never been married and lives alone.\n\nRyan was born and raised in Casper, Wyoming, where he attended local schools and graduated from Natrona County High School. After completing high school, he did not pursue higher education, instead opting to enter the workforce directly. He has worked in the oil and gas industry for most of his life, currently holding a job as a Maintenance Technician for a local oil refinery. His annual income is $63,000, which is slightly above the median household income in Casper.\n\nRyan's economic situation is stable, with a steady income and a paid-off mortgage on his home. However, he is concerned about the fluctuations in the oil and gas industry, which have led to layoffs and economic downturns in the past. He is also worried about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly the increasing prices of groceries and healthcare.\n\nAs a homeowner, Ryan is invested in his community and takes pride in maintaining his property. He spends his free time outdoors, hiking and fishing in the nearby mountains and lakes. Ryan's lack of family responsibilities gives him the freedom to pursue his hobbies and interests without significant financial burdens.\n\nRyan's educational background has not limited his career advancement, but he recognizes the importance of continuous learning in his field. He regularly attends workshops and training sessions to stay updated on the latest technologies and safety protocols in the oil and gas industry.\n\nAs a US-born citizen, Ryan is proud of his American heritage and values the freedom and opportunities that come with it. His economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and the overall well-being of his community. Ryan's views on politics are shaped by his personal experiences and the issues that affect him directly, such as the regulation of the oil and gas industry and the management of public lands in Wyoming."
