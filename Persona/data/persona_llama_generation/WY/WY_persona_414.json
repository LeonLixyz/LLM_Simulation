  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Emily, who is the household's primary income earner. Ryan is a non-veteran and has been married to Emily for about 8 years. They have two children, ages 6 and 8, who attend a local public elementary school. \n\nRyan holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, which he obtained from the University of Wyoming. After college, he worked as a management trainee for a large retail chain in Cheyenne but left the job after five years to start his own small business, a coffee shop in the downtown area. The coffee shop has been moderately successful, generating an annual income of around $60,000 for Ryan. Emily, on the other hand, works as a high school teacher, earning a salary of $55,000 per year.\n\nThe Thompsons own a single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood, which they purchased for $280,000 about 6 years ago. Their monthly mortgage payment is around $1,800, and they also pay about $150 per month in property taxes. They have two cars: a 2018 Toyota Camry and a 2020 Honda Odyssey, which they use for family transportation.\n\nRyan's family is his top priority, and he values the flexibility his small business provides in terms of spending time with his children and supporting Emily's teaching career. He is concerned about the rising costs of living in Cheyenne, particularly the increasing property taxes and healthcare expenses, which affect his family's budget and the profitability of his coffee shop.\n\nIn his free time, Ryan enjoys hiking and camping in the nearby mountains, volunteering at his children's school, and participating in local community events. He is fluent in English and has never spoken any other language at home. Ryan is a proud Wyoming native, born and raised in Cheyenne, and identifies strongly with the state's culture and values."
