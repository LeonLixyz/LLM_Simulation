  "PERSONA": "Dorothy \"Dottie\" Wilson, a 79-year-old white female, is a widow who has been living in a homeless shelter in Casper, Wyoming, for the past year. She was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and has spent most of her life in the state. Dottie holds a Bachelor's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in 1968. \n\nAfter graduating, Dottie worked as a high school teacher for 25 years, teaching English and History in various schools across Wyoming. She is fluent in English and has no proficiency in any other language. Dottie's husband, a retired mechanic, passed away in 2018, leaving her with significant medical bills and a reduced pension. As a result, she struggled to maintain their mortgage payments and eventually lost her home to foreclosure. \n\nDottie's economic situation is precarious. She receives a monthly Social Security benefit of $1,200 and a small pension of $800 from her teaching days. However, her income is barely enough to cover her living expenses, which include $500 per month for a shared room at the shelter and $200 for food and other essentials. Dottie's top economic concerns are access to affordable healthcare and housing. She relies on Medicaid for her medical needs and hopes to secure a spot in a subsidized senior housing program.\n\nAs a widow living in a homeless shelter, Dottie's family structure is limited to her adult children, who live out of state and are unable to provide financial support. Her economic priorities are centered around securing stable housing and accessing affordable healthcare services. Given her background as a teacher and her current situation, Dottie is likely to support policies that address income inequality, affordable housing, and access to healthcare for low-income seniors."
