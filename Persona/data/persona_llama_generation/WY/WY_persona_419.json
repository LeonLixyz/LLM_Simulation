  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 49-year-old white male, born and raised in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Maria, and they have been together for over 20 years. They reside in a two-story, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, Wyoming's second-largest city. Juan and Maria have two children: a 17-year-old son, Carlos, who is a high school senior, and a 14-year-old daughter, Sophia, who is in the ninth grade.\n\nJuan is a high school graduate, having attended Natrona County High School in Casper. After high school, he immediately entered the workforce, starting as a mechanic's assistant at a local auto repair shop. Over the years, he worked his way up to become a skilled automotive technician, eventually landing a job at a Chevrolet dealership in Casper. Juan has been working at the dealership for over a decade and is well-respected by his colleagues and customers alike.\n\nAs a Spanish-speaking household, Juan and his family maintain strong ties to their cultural heritage, often celebrating traditional Mexican holidays and cooking authentic meals. Despite being born in the United States, Juan's parents immigrated from Mexico, and he is proud of his roots. He speaks English well, having learned it as a child, but Spanish is his primary language at home.\n\nJuan's annual household income is around $73,000, with his wife Maria contributing to the family income as a part-time dental hygienist. They own their home, which they purchased 15 years ago for $180,000. The mortgage is nearly paid off, and they are proud of their accomplishment. Juan is concerned about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly the increasing prices of groceries and healthcare. He is also worried about the impact of automation on his job as an automotive technician and the future of his son's education and career prospects.\n\nAs a homeowner and a family man, Juan is invested in his community and is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to education, job security, and affordable healthcare. He values hard work, family, and tradition, and these principles guide his economic and political views."
