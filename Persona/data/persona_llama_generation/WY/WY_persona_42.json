  "PERSONA": "Meet 49-year-old Karen Thompson, a US-born White female who resides in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of her single-person household and has been married, but is currently separated from her husband. Karen does not have any children.\n\nKaren was born in Montana but moved to Wyoming for better job opportunities. She holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration, which she earned from a local community college in Wyoming. Prior to her current situation, Karen worked as an administrative assistant in a small accounting firm in Cody. However, due to company restructuring, she lost her job and has been out of the labor force for the past two years.\n\nKaren's annual income is around $29,500, which she earns through a combination of part-time freelance work and support from her estranged husband. Despite her best efforts, she struggles to make ends meet and has been unable to secure full-time employment in the limited job market of Cody. As a result, she does not have health insurance coverage, relying on community clinics and non-profit organizations for medical care.\n\nKaren is fluent in English and has a strong sense of community involvement. She participates in local volunteer work, focusing on animal welfare and environmental conservation. Her economic concerns revolve around finding stable employment, accessing affordable healthcare, and managing her household expenses on a limited budget. Given her situation, Karen is likely to prioritize policies that address job creation, affordable healthcare, and social support for single households.\n\nKaren rents a modest one-bedroom apartment in a quiet neighborhood, paying around $700 per month. She owns a 10-year-old sedan and relies on it for transportation. Despite the challenges she faces, Karen remains optimistic about her future and is actively seeking opportunities to improve her economic situation."
