  "PERSONA": "Karen Thompson, a 62-year-old white female, is the primary householder in a married-couple household without children. She has been married to her husband, Michael, for over 35 years. Born and raised in Wyoming, Karen is a US citizen by birth and has always resided in the state, currently living in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, the state capital.\n\nKaren holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Laramie County Community College. After completing her education, she worked as an administrative assistant in a local insurance firm for over two decades before transitioning into a part-time role as an office manager at a small dental clinic in Cheyenne. Her annual income is approximately $43,000, supplemented by her husband's pension from his career as a retired high school teacher. Their combined household income is around $73,000.\n\nThe couple owns a single-family home in a moderately-priced neighborhood, valued at $280,000, with a mortgage of $120,000. They have lived in this house for over 20 years, having raised their family there before their children moved out. Their two adult children, both in their 30s, are married with kids and live in nearby towns.\n\nAs a homemaker and part-time worker, Karen's primary economic concerns revolve around maintaining a comfortable lifestyle during retirement, ensuring they can cover healthcare expenses, and keeping their home. She is fluent in English, having spoken it her entire life, and has never served in the military. Her husband's pension and their combined income provide a stable financial foundation, but Karen is keenly aware of the importance of budgeting and saving for the future.\n\nKaren's educational background has significantly impacted her career choices and trajectory, leading her to administrative roles that value her organizational skills and experience. As a lifelong Wyoming resident, Karen is deeply rooted in her community and is familiar with local issues and concerns, particularly those related to education, healthcare, and economic development in rural areas."
