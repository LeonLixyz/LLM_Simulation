  "PERSONA": "Maria Elena Hernandez, a 29-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, is the primary householder of her single-person household in Casper, Wyoming. She is a widow, having lost her spouse two years ago in a tragic accident. Maria was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, to Mexican immigrant parents and identifies as a US citizen by birth.\n\nMaria lives in a modest, rented one-bedroom apartment in a mixed-income neighborhood, paying $800 per month. She works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local non-profit organization focused on environmental conservation, earning $35,000 per year. Her job requires strong English communication skills, which she acquired through her high school education and some college coursework in business administration. Although she didn't complete her degree, Maria's strong work ethic and proficiency in English have enabled her to secure stable employment.\n\nAs a widow, Maria's primary economic concerns revolve around financial security and stability. She is careful with her expenses, allocating 30% of her income toward rent, 20% toward utilities and groceries, and 15% toward saving for long-term goals, such as purchasing a home. Her experience of losing her spouse at a young age has made her acutely aware of the importance of having a safety net, leading her to prioritize building an emergency fund and investing in life insurance.\n\nMaria's marital status and lack of children mean she has more flexibility in her daily life, but she also faces unique challenges as a young widow. She has become more involved in her community, volunteering at local events and participating in online forums focused on environmental issues and women's empowerment. These activities help her stay connected with others and give her a sense of purpose beyond her work.\n\nIn her free time, Maria enjoys hiking in the nearby mountains, practicing yoga, and reading about sustainable living. She is concerned about the economic implications of climate change on her community and the state's reliance on fossil fuels. As a result, she supports policies that promote renewable energy sources and job creation in the green sector.\n\nMaria's economic priorities include affordable housing, access to quality education and job training programs, and social safety nets for widows and single women. Her experiences have made her more empathetic toward others facing similar challenges, and she is likely to support policies that address income inequality, healthcare access, and community development initiatives."
