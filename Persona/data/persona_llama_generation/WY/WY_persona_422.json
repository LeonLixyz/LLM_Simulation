  "PERSONA": "Name: Sandra Thompson\nAge: 68 years\nSex: Female\nRace: White\nEthnicity: Assuming non-Hispanic, given the lack of specified ethnicity and the state of residence being Wyoming, where the Hispanic population is relatively low.\n\nRelationship Status: Never married, living with her parents, indicating a close-knit family structure where Sandra might have taken on a caregiver role or has chosen to remain in the family home for financial or personal reasons.\n\nResidence: A rural town in Wyoming, such as Cody, reflecting the state's sparse population and Sandra's birth and residence within the state.\n\nEducation: A high school graduate from Cody High School, with her education being completed within the Wyoming public school system. Her high school education has equipped her with basic skills but may limit her job opportunities in certain sectors.\n\nLanguage and Proficiency: Speaks English well, with no other languages spoken at home. This proficiency in English is crucial for her interactions within the community and job opportunities.\n\nEmployment: Works part-time as a librarian at the local public library, a job that requires strong communication skills and is often available to individuals with a high school diploma. Her part-time status might be due to her age or the need to care for her parents.\n\nIncome: Earns approximately $25,000 annually, a modest income reflective of part-time work in a small town. This income level places her in a lower-middle-class category, where economic concerns such as healthcare, retirement savings, and living costs are significant.\n\nHome Situation: Lives in her family home, a modest, single-story house built in the 1960s, which has been in the family for years. The house is owned by her parents, but Sandra contributes to the household expenses, helping with mortgage payments, utilities, and upkeep.\n\nFamily Responsibilities: As the child living with her parents, Sandra is likely involved in caregiving, assisting with daily tasks, and managing the household. Her never-married status and living arrangement suggest a strong family bond and a prioritization of family responsibilities.\n\nEconomic Concerns: Given her age, income level, and family responsibilities, Sandra's economic concerns likely revolve around ensuring her parents' well-being, saving for her own retirement, and managing the household expenses. She might be concerned about healthcare costs, especially as her parents age, and the potential need for long-term care.\n\nPolitical Views: Sandra's political views might lean towards policies that support seniors, such as Social Security and Medicare, given her family situation and economic status. She may also be interested in local policies affecting small-town Wyoming, such as education funding, rural healthcare access, and community development initiatives.\n\nOverall, Sandra Thompson is a 68-year-old woman living in a rural Wyoming town, closely tied to her family and community. Her economic and political views are shaped by her role as a caregiver, her modest income, and her experiences living in a small, tight-knit community."
