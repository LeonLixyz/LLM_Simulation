  "PERSONA": "Ana Moreno is a 78-year-old white female, a widow who resides with her relatives in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Colorado but having spent most of her life in Wyoming, Ana has a strong connection to her community and is a proud US citizen. She speaks English well, which she learned in school, but her primary language at home is Spanish, reflecting her cultural heritage.\n\nAna graduated from high school in the late 1950s, which was a significant achievement for her family and a testament to her determination. Following high school, she entered the workforce as a secretary in a local insurance company, where she worked for over two decades before retiring at the age of 65. Her income from her pension and social security benefits is approximately $35,000 per year, which allows her to live comfortably with her relatives.\n\nAs a widow, Ana's marital status significantly influences her economic concerns and priorities. She lost her husband ten years ago, and since then, she has been living with her niece and her family. This living arrangement not only provides her with a sense of family and community but also helps with household expenses. The house, which her niece owns, is a modest three-bedroom home in a quiet neighborhood, with a mortgage of $1,200 per month.\n\nAna's economic concerns are centered around healthcare and long-term care. As she ages, she worries about the increasing costs of medical care and the potential need for assisted living in the future. She is keenly interested in policies that address these concerns, such as affordable healthcare and elder care programs. Her political views are shaped by her desire to maintain her independence, ensure her economic security, and preserve the quality of life for herself and her loved ones."
