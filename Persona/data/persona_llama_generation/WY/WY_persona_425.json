  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 38-year-old Hispanic male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in the United States to parents of Mexican descent, Juan identifies as \"Other Hispanic or Latino.\" He is the spouse of the household, residing with his long-term partner, Alex, whom he has been with for over a decade. Although they have not gotten married, they consider each other their life partners and have a stable, long-term commitment.\n\nJuan's educational background is limited to middle school, having dropped out of 8th grade due to family financial constraints. He had to start working early to support his family, which significantly impacted his career trajectory. Currently, Juan works as a laborer in the construction industry, specifically in the residential sector, earning a modest income of $42,000 per year. His job is physically demanding, with variable hours that often extend beyond the standard 40-hour workweek.\n\nJuan and Alex rent a two-bedroom apartment in a working-class neighborhood in Cheyenne. Their rent is $900 per month, which is relatively affordable considering the area's median rent. They have been trying to save for a down payment on a house but find it challenging due to their limited income and the increasing housing prices in Wyoming.\n\nAs a non-veteran and someone with limited education, Juan's economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and access to better-paying job opportunities. He is fluent in English and has no proficiency in any other language. Given his economic situation, Juan's political views tend to lean towards policies that support workers' rights, affordable housing initiatives, and education/training programs that can help individuals like him acquire new skills and improve their socio-economic status.\n\nIn his free time, Juan enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and fishing, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. He is also an avid follower of local sports teams and enjoys watching games with friends and family. Despite the challenges he faces, Juan remains optimistic about his future and is determined to create a better life for himself and his partner."
