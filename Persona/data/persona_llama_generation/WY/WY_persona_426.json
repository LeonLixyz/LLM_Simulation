  "PERSONA": "Meet 49-year-old Ryan Thompson, a white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Colorado, Ryan has been a resident of Wyoming for over a decade, having moved for work opportunities. As the spouse of a household holder, Ryan lives with his partner, Mark, whom he met in college and has been in a committed relationship with for over 20 years. Despite their long-term commitment, Ryan and Mark have chosen not to formalize their relationship through marriage, aligning with Ryan's \"Never married\" status.\n\nRyan holds an associate's degree in mechanical engineering from a community college in Colorado but did not complete his bachelor's degree due to financial constraints and a desire to enter the workforce sooner. This educational background has served him well in his current role as a senior mechanical technician at a local manufacturing facility, where he has worked for eight years. His annual income is $62,000, which, combined with Mark's income as a schoolteacher, provides a comfortable living for the couple.\n\nRyan and Mark own a modest two-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they purchased six years ago for $220,000. They have a mortgage with a monthly payment of $1,300 and are proud of the equity they've built in their home. Their household is relatively stable, with Ryan focusing on his career and Mark on his teaching position and part-time work as a tutor.\n\nRyan's economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs, as Mark has a chronic condition that requires regular medical attention. They have good health insurance through Mark's employer, but the out-of-pocket expenses can be burdensome at times. Ryan is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly housing prices, which he fears could outpace their income and savings. Despite these concerns, Ryan is optimistic about their financial future and is actively involved in planning for their retirement.\n\nPolitically, Ryan tends to lean towards moderate policies that support local businesses, affordable healthcare, and education. He is a registered Democrat but has voted for Republican candidates in local elections when he felt they better represented his economic interests. Ryan is active in his community, volunteering at a local animal shelter and participating in neighborhood initiatives to improve public spaces."
