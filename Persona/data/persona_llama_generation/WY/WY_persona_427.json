  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Elena Morales, a retired administrative assistant who lives in the small town of Lander, Wyoming, with her husband, 70-year-old Michael. Born and raised in Wyoming, Elena identifies her race as \"Some Other Race,\" reflecting her mixed Hispanic and Native American heritage, common in the region. Assuming her ethnicity is \"Hispanic or Latino\" based on her surname and geographic location, which is a reasonable assumption given the context.\n\nElena's household is a married-couple family, with her being the spouse of the householder. They own their home, a cozy two-bedroom house near downtown Lander, which they've lived in for over 20 years. Their mortgage is nearly paid off, and they've managed to save a modest nest egg from Michael's retirement from the local school district and Elena's part-time work as an administrative assistant.\n\nElena's educational background consists of two years of community college, where she studied business administration but didn't complete her degree due to family obligations. Despite this, she found stable employment in various administrative roles throughout her life, which has contributed to her relatively comfortable retirement. Her English proficiency is excellent, having been born and raised in the United States and speaking English as her primary language.\n\nAs a retiree, Elena's annual household income is approximately $55,000, comprising Michael's pension, her part-time income from occasional administrative work, and their Social Security benefits. They've managed to live within their means, with a strong emphasis on saving and planning for the future. However, they do worry about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact on their retirement savings.\n\nElena's concerns about the economy are centered around access to quality, affordable healthcare, particularly in rural areas like Lander. She's also interested in policies that support small businesses and local economic development, as she's witnessed the challenges faced by entrepreneurs in her community. Her political views tend to be moderate, with a focus on practical solutions that benefit her community and ensure a secure retirement for herself and her husband."
