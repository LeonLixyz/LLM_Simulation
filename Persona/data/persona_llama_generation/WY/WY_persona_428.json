  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Garcia is a 22-year-old, white, U.S.-born female who resides with her parents in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a non-veteran and has never been married. Alex's first language is Spanish, but she speaks English well, having been born and raised in the United States. Her parents, both of whom she lives with, are likely bilingual as well, having relocated to Wyoming from New Mexico for work opportunities when Alex was a child.\n\nAlex attended Cheyenne Central High School and later enrolled in Laramie County Community College, where she studied business administration for two years before deciding to take a break. She currently works part-time as a sales associate at a local retail store, earning around $25,000 per year. Her job provides her with a flexible schedule, allowing her to pursue other interests, such as volunteering at a local animal shelter and taking online courses to improve her graphic design skills.\n\nAs a child living with her parents, Alex contributes to the household income but does not pay rent. Her parents, both in their late 40s, work full-time - her father as an accountant and her mother as a nurse. The family owns a modest, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood, which they purchased about five years ago. Alex's economic concerns center around saving money for her education and future career goals, as well as helping her parents with household expenses when needed.\n\nAlex's educational background has influenced her career trajectory, as she initially aspired to become a business owner but is now considering a career in graphic design. Her family structure and responsibilities have instilled in her a sense of financial responsibility and a strong work ethic, which drives her to balance her part-time job with personal interests and future educational pursuits.\n\nGiven her situation, Alex's economic priorities include affordable education, job security, and access to resources that can help her achieve her career goals. Her political views are likely shaped by her experiences as a young, working-class woman in a conservative state, with a focus on issues like affordable healthcare, education, and economic opportunities for young people."
