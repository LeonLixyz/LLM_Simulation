  "PERSONA": "Name: Carlos Rivera\nAge: 29 years\nSex: Male\nRace: Hispanic\nEthnicity: Puerto Rican\n\nBackground: Born in Wyoming to Puerto Rican parents who moved to the United States for work, Carlos is a first-generation Wyomingite. He identifies as Puerto Rican and has a strong connection to his cultural heritage, celebrating traditional holidays and speaking some Spanish at home, although English is his primary language.\n\nRelationship Status: Carlos is married to his high school sweetheart, Emily, who works as a part-time teacher at a local elementary school. They met in their senior year of high school and got married after Carlos finished his bachelor's degree. They do not have children yet but plan to start a family soon.\n\nResidence: Carlos and Emily live in a two-bedroom apartment in a relatively new complex in Casper, the second-largest city in Wyoming. They rent their apartment for $900 per month, which is about 25% of their combined income. They have been renting for two years now and are considering buying a home in the next two to three years.\n\nEducation: Carlos holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he completed in four years. During his college years, he worked part-time jobs to help pay for his tuition fees and living expenses.\n\nOccupation: Carlos works as a marketing specialist for a small firm in Casper that specializes in digital marketing services for local businesses. He has been working there for three years and earns $55,000 per year. Emily's part-time teaching job supplements their income, bringing their combined annual income to around $70,000.\n\nEconomic Situation: Carlos and Emily's combined income allows them to live comfortably, but they are mindful of their expenses. They prioritize saving for a down payment on a house, retirement, and starting a family. They also try to reduce their expenses by cooking at home, canceling subscription services they don't use, and shopping during sales.\n\nEconomic Concerns: Carlos is concerned about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly the increasing housing costs, which might make it difficult for them to afford a home in the future. He is also worried about the impact of automation on his job and the local economy, as Wyoming's economy is heavily reliant on the energy industry, which is subject to fluctuations in global demand.\n\nPolitics: Carlos is a registered Democrat and tends to vote for candidates who support education, healthcare, and economic development initiatives that benefit local communities. He is also interested in environmental issues, particularly those related to the conservation of Wyoming's natural resources."
