  "PERSONA": "Ana Maria Hernandez, a 38-year-old single mother of two, is the primary householder of her household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Mexican parents, Ana identifies as Hispanic with Mexican ethnicity. She holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which has been instrumental in her career as an Environmental Consultant for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nAna's household consists of her 10-year-old daughter, Sophia, and her 7-year-old son, Mateo. Despite never being married, Ana has established a stable home for her children in a modest, two-bedroom house in a mixed-income neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. She has lived in Wyoming for over a decade, drawn by the state's natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities, which align with her professional interests.\n\nAna's annual household income is approximately $63,000, primarily from her consulting work, supplemented by part-time teaching at a local community college. Her financial priorities include saving for her children's education, paying off her mortgage, and managing the household expenses, which include a car loan for her 2018 Honda CR-V.\n\nAs a single mother with a demanding career, Ana values policies that support working families, such as affordable childcare, flexible work arrangements, and access to quality education. Her concerns about the local economy include the impact of climate change on Wyoming's natural resources, the need for diversification of the state's economy beyond the energy sector, and ensuring that economic development benefits all communities, including low-income and minority populations.\n\nAna is fluent in English, having grown up in a bilingual household, and has a strong command of the language, which has facilitated her career advancement. Her experience as a single mother and her professional background in environmental science inform her views on economic and political issues, making her a unique and engaged member of her community."
