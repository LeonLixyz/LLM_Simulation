  "PERSONA": "Maria Rodriguez, an 87-year-old White female, lives in a rural area of Wyoming with her 92-year-old husband, Carlos. Given her age, and assuming she has moved back in with her family for care, she resides with her 65-year-old son, Juan, and his wife, who are her primary caregivers.\n\nMaria was born in New Mexico but has lived in Wyoming for over 30 years, moving there with her husband for his job as a rancher. She is a US citizen, born and raised in the United States, and speaks Spanish as her primary language but is proficient in English.\n\nMaria is a high school graduate, having completed her education in a small town in New Mexico. She did not pursue higher education due to family obligations and the economic situation at the time. Throughout her life, Maria worked various part-time jobs, mainly in retail and as a homemaker, supporting her family while her husband worked as a rancher.\n\nMaria and Carlos have been married for 62 years. They have three children, with Juan being the youngest. Their two older children live out of state, and due to Maria's health issues and Carlos's advanced age, they decided it would be best for them to move in with Juan and his wife, who have a large house with enough space for them.\n\nMaria's economic situation is modest, living off her husband's pension and social security. Her primary economic concerns are healthcare costs, especially with her age and the need for ongoing medical care. She is worried about the rising costs of prescription medication and the impact of potential policy changes on her access to necessary healthcare services.\n\nGiven her rural location, Maria is also concerned about the lack of access to certain amenities and services, such as reliable internet and specialized medical care, which are often taken for granted in urban areas. Her political views are shaped by her experiences as a rural resident, a senior citizen, and someone who has seen the challenges faced by her community."
