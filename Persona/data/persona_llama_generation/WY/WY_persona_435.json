  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson, an 87-year-old white male, has lived in a small, single-family home in Cheyenne, Wyoming, for the past 40 years. As the primary householder, Harold owns his home outright, having paid off the mortgage 15 years ago. He has never been married and has no children, which has allowed him to focus on his career and personal interests.\n\nHarold holds a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of Wyoming College of Law, which he earned in 1967. After law school, he worked as an attorney specializing in water rights law, a critical field in Wyoming due to the state's complex water usage regulations. He spent 30 years practicing law before retiring at the age of 65.\n\nAs a retired attorney, Harold's annual income is approximately $60,000, consisting of a combination of his pension, Social Security benefits, and investments. He is fluent in English and has never spoken any other language at home.\n\nHarold's economic concerns are centered around maintaining his current standard of living, particularly in the face of rising healthcare costs and potential changes to Social Security. He is also interested in policies that support local economic development in Wyoming, especially those related to agriculture and natural resource management.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Harold values independence and self-reliance, which influences his political views. He is likely to support policies that promote individual freedom, limited government intervention, and the protection of property rights. However, his experience as a water rights attorney has also made him aware of the importance of government regulation in certain areas, leading to a nuanced view of government intervention in the economy.\n\nAs a resident of Cheyenne, Harold is active in his community, volunteering at the local historical society and participating in neighborhood initiatives. He is well-respected in his community and values his relationships with his neighbors and friends."
