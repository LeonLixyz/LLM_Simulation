  "PERSONA": "Meet Barbara, a 68-year-old white female, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. She has been married to her husband, John, for 45 years, and they have two adult children who have moved out of the house. Barbara is a high school graduate and has always been proud of her education, which she completed at a local public school in Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital city, where she has lived for most of her life.\n\nBarbara's husband is the primary breadwinner, working as a retired mechanic with a pension. Barbara has worked part-time jobs throughout her life, including a stint as a librarian at a local library and later as a part-time administrative assistant at a small business. Her last job ended when she turned 62, and she decided to focus on her family and hobbies. Her combined household income is around $55,000 per year, with John's pension making up the bulk of their income.\n\nThe couple owns a modest, single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood in Cheyenne, which they purchased in 1985 for $120,000. The house is now valued at around $280,000, and they have paid off most of their mortgage. They have two grandchildren who live in the nearby town of Laramie and visit regularly.\n\nBarbara is fluent in English and has never spoken any other language at home. She is a US citizen by birth and has never lived outside of Wyoming. Her family has a strong tradition of civic engagement, with her father having served as a local council member. Barbara has always been interested in local politics, particularly issues related to education and healthcare.\n\nAs a retiree, Barbara's economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs, social security, and maintaining her standard of living. She is worried about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing costs of healthcare and housing. She is also concerned about the impact of climate change on Wyoming's economy and the state's reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nAssumptions made: \n- Household type is assumed to be a married-couple family based on the marital status and household relationship.\n- Ethnicity is assumed to be non-Hispanic, given the lack of information.\n- Neighborhood type is assumed to be middle-class, given the house value and location."
