  "PERSONA": "Meet Barbara \"Barb\" Thompson, a 62-year-old white female who lives in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. She resides with her 85-year-old mother, Margaret, in a single-family home that has been in their family for over three decades. The house, located in a quiet neighborhood near the local high school, is valued at approximately $240,000. Barb's father passed away five years ago, and since then, she has taken on more responsibilities in caring for her mother.\n\nBarb is a veteran of the US Army, where she served for six years as a logistics specialist, achieving the rank of Sergeant (E-5). After her service, she utilized the GI Bill to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming. Following graduation, Barb worked for the Wyoming Department of Transportation for over 20 years, eventually retiring as a senior administrative assistant with a pension.\n\nAssuming she never married due to her focus on career and family responsibilities, Barb's annual income from her pension is around $55,000. She also earns an additional $12,000 per year from part-time work as an administrative assistant for a local non-profit organization focused on environmental conservation. Her combined income allows her to support herself and contribute to her mother's care, including hiring part-time home health aides when necessary.\n\nBarb's education and work experience have significantly influenced her economic views. She values stability and security, having experienced the benefits of a steady job and pension firsthand. Her time in the military also instilled in her a strong sense of discipline and respect for public service. Barb is concerned about the impact of budget cuts on veterans' services and the rising costs of healthcare, particularly for seniors like her mother.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Barb is familiar with the challenges faced by rural communities, including limited access to healthcare services and high-speed internet. Her part-time work with the non-profit has also made her aware of environmental issues affecting the state, such as the decline of coal mining and the need for sustainable economic development.\n\nBarb's daily life revolves around caring for her mother, working part-time, and volunteering in her community. She is an active member of the local VFW post and participates in town hall meetings, where she voices her opinions on issues affecting veterans, seniors, and the local economy. Her experiences and concerns shape her economic and political views, making her a thoughtful and engaged citizen in her community."
