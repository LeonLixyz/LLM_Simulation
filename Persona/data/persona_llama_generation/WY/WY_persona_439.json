  "PERSONA": "Emilia \"Mia\" Santos is a 79-year-old Filipino-American woman living in the small town of Jackson, Wyoming. She resides with her 95-year-old mother, Josefina, in a modest, single-story house they own in a quiet neighborhood near the town center. Mia's father passed away five years ago, and since then, she has been the primary caregiver for her mother, who suffers from mild dementia. This living arrangement is a result of her strong family ties and the cultural values she was raised with, emphasizing respect and care for elders.\n\nMia was born in Hawaii but moved to Wyoming with her parents when she was a teenager. She obtained an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education from Casper College and worked as a preschool teacher for over 20 years before retiring. After her divorce in her mid-40s, Mia focused on raising her two children, who now live in other states with their families. Her son is a software engineer in California, and her daughter is a nurse in Colorado. Despite the distance, Mia is very close to her children and grandchildren, who visit her and her mother during holidays and summer breaks.\n\nMia's annual household income is approximately $43,000, which comes from her retirement savings, her mother's pension, and a part-time job as a library assistant. She is proud of her financial independence and frugality, skills she developed during her marriage and honed after her divorce. Mia is meticulous about budgeting and saving, often clipping coupons and shopping during sales to make ends meet. She owns her home outright, having paid off the mortgage years ago, which significantly reduces her living expenses.\n\nMia's economic concerns include the rising cost of healthcare for her mother and the potential impact of policy changes on her retirement benefits. She is also worried about the increasing cost of living in Jackson, particularly housing costs, which she believes could displace long-time residents like herself. Politically, Mia tends to vote for candidates who support education, healthcare, and social security, reflecting her experiences as a teacher, caregiver, and retiree.\n\nIn her free time, Mia enjoys gardening, cooking traditional Filipino dishes, and volunteering at the local library. She is an avid reader and loves attending community events, such as farmers' markets and cultural festivals. Mia's strong sense of community and family ties, combined with her life experiences, shape her economic and political views, making her a unique and engaged member of her small Wyoming town."
