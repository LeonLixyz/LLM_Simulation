  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male living in a rural area of Wyoming. He resides with his parents in a single-family home in the outskirts of Cheyenne, the state capital. Ryan is married, but his wife, Sarah, currently lives in a nearby town where she works as a nurse, and they are temporarily separated due to work commitments. They have a 5-year-old daughter, Emily, who lives with Ryan and his parents.\n\nRyan holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Laramie County Community College, which he earned in 2009. After working as a mechanic for several years, he had to leave the workforce due to a back injury sustained in a car accident. He has been unable to find suitable employment since then and is currently not in the labor force.\n\nRyan's annual household income is around $42,500, which is mostly comprised of his disability benefits and some occasional freelance mechanic work. His family's financial situation is challenging, and they struggle to make ends meet, which is exacerbated by the lack of health insurance coverage for Ryan. His parents, both retired, contribute to the household income with their social security benefits and a small pension.\n\nRyan is fluent in English, having been born and raised in Wyoming. He is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. His economic concerns include accessing affordable healthcare, finding stable employment that accommodates his disability, and ensuring a secure financial future for his family. Despite these challenges, Ryan is hopeful about his situation improving and is currently exploring vocational rehabilitation programs to enhance his employability.\n\nGiven his situation, Ryan is likely to be concerned about economic policies related to healthcare access, disability support, and job creation in rural areas. His experiences and priorities would likely influence his views on political issues, focusing on practical solutions that address the needs of individuals and families in similar situations."
