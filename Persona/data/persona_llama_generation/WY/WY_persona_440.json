  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 38-year-old White male, born and raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where he still resides with his parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood. Ethan's ethnicity is assumed to be non-Hispanic, given the lack of specified ethnicity and his English-only language proficiency.\n\nEthan's educational background includes two years of study at Laramie County Community College, where he pursued an associate's degree in automotive technology. However, he left college without a degree to work full-time at a local car dealership, where he is currently employed as a service advisor, earning an annual salary of $48,000. This income allows him to contribute to the household expenses and maintain a moderate lifestyle.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Ethan's life trajectory has been focused on his family and career. Living with his parents has provided him with financial stability, enabling him to save for his future goals, such as buying his own home and starting a family. Ethan's parents, both in their early sixties, are still working, with his father employed as a retired state employee working part-time and his mother working as a part-time librarian.\n\nEthan's economic concerns center around saving for a down payment on a house, navigating the rising costs of living in Cheyenne, and securing a better-paying job within his field. He is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to affordable housing, education, and economic development in Wyoming. As a child living with his parents, Ethan's financial priorities are influenced by his family's situation, and he is likely to support policies that benefit middle-class families and promote economic growth in his community.\n\nIn his free time, Ethan enjoys outdoor activities, such as hiking and fishing, which are readily available in Wyoming's natural landscapes. He also volunteers at a local car repair workshop that offers free services to low-income families, reflecting his commitment to giving back to his community."
