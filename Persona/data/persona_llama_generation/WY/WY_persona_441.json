  "PERSONA": "Evelyn Thompson, a 68-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming, with her husband of 45 years, John. They reside in a modest, single-story home in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Casper, which they purchased in 1985 for $120,000 and have since paid off.\n\nEvelyn is a high school graduate, having attended Natrona County High School. She did not pursue higher education, instead choosing to enter the workforce directly after graduation. Evelyn spent most of her working life as an administrative assistant in a local insurance firm, earning a steady income that, when combined with her husband's income as a retired mechanic, allowed them to live comfortably. She retired in 2010, and since then, has been managing the household and taking care of her aging mother, who moved in with them after Evelyn's father passed away.\n\nEvelyn and John have two adult children who have moved out of the house, both of whom are married with children of their own. Their son, Michael, lives in nearby Cheyenne, working as an engineer, while their daughter, Emily, resides in Denver, Colorado, where she is a teacher. Evelyn and John enjoy spending time with their four grandchildren, often babysitting and participating in local family events.\n\nEvelyn's economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs and Social Security. As someone living on a fixed income, she is particularly sensitive to changes in Medicare and the overall cost of living in Wyoming. She is also keenly aware of the challenges faced by younger generations in terms of job security and affordable housing, issues her children have navigated.\n\nGiven her long-term residency in Wyoming and her involvement in local community activities, Evelyn feels a strong connection to her community. She is an active voter and participates in local elections, prioritizing issues related to education, healthcare, and economic development in her voting decisions. Despite not having a college education, Evelyn values knowledge and is an avid reader, often engaging in discussions about current events and politics with her friends and family.\n\nAssumptions made based on the metadata include Evelyn's household type being a family household, given her marital status and the presence of her mother in the home. Her ethnicity is assumed to be non-Hispanic, given the absence of any information suggesting otherwise and the context of her other demographic information."
