Alex holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he completed two years ago. He is fluent in English and speaks it well, having grown up in a monolingual household. As a non-veteran, Alex's professional life has focused on his academic pursuits and subsequent career.\n\nProfessionally, Alex works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm, earning a salary of $62,000 per year. His job involves assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of development projects in the region. This role aligns with his passion for sustainability and his graduate studies. The job also offers a stable income, allowing him to support himself and Rachel, who is pursuing her Ph.D. in a related field.\n\nAlex and Rachel live in a rented, two-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood in Laramie. Their rent is $1,200 per month, which is relatively affordable given the local cost of living. They have no children but are planning to start a family in the near future. As a result, they are keenly interested in local policies related to education, healthcare, and family support.\n\nDespite being categorized as \"Never married\" due to not having a legal marriage, Alex and Rachel have been in a committed relationship for five years and consider themselves a household unit. They share financial responsibilities and make decisions jointly, including planning for their future and managing their current living situation.\n\nGiven their economic situation, Alex and Rachel prioritize issues related to affordable housing, access to quality education, and job security. They are also keenly aware of the environmental challenges facing Wyoming and support policies that promote sustainability and protect natural resources. Their combined income and stable employment situation place them in a relatively secure economic position, but they are mindful of the broader economic trends and how they might impact their future plans."
