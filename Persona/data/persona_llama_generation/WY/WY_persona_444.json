  "PERSONA": "Meet Maria Rodriguez, a 79-year-old White female, born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She lives with her 105-year-old mother in a two-bedroom apartment in the historic downtown area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Maria is married to her 82-year-old husband, Juan, whom she met while pursuing her graduate studies in the United States. They have been married for 55 years and have two grown children who live out of state.\n\nMaria holds a Master's degree in Spanish Literature from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in the late 1960s. Her educational background and proficiency in English have enabled her to work as a part-time Spanish instructor at the local community college for over three decades. Although she is retired, Maria continues to teach one class per semester due to her passion for sharing her native language and culture.\n\nMaria's husband, Juan, is a retired engineer who worked for the state's transportation department. His pension and Maria's part-time income provide them with a comfortable annual household income of around $65,000. They own their apartment, which they purchased in the early 1990s for $120,000, and have no outstanding mortgage.\n\nAs a non-U.S. citizen, Maria has a green card and is in the process of applying for citizenship. She is fluent in English and has been actively involved in local politics, particularly in advocating for immigrant rights and education. Maria's economic concerns include affordable healthcare, social security, and the rising cost of living in Cheyenne. She is also worried about the potential impact of immigration policies on her family and community.\n\nMaria's living situation, with her mother requiring full-time care, has become a significant challenge. She has had to balance her part-time work with caregiving responsibilities, which has taken a toll on her physical and mental health. As a result, Maria is eager to see improvements in the healthcare system, particularly in terms of elder care and support for caregivers.\n\nMaria's family structure and responsibilities have shaped her economic and political views. She is keenly aware of the importance of social services, education, and community support. Her experiences as an immigrant and a caregiver have made her an advocate for policies that promote inclusivity, accessibility, and affordability."
