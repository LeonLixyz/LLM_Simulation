  "PERSONA": "Meet 57-year-old Brian, a white male living in Wyoming. He has never been married and resides in a household as an other relative of the householder, specifically his younger sister, who is the primary homeowner. Brian's family moved to Wyoming from Illinois when he was a teenager, and he has considered the Mountain West his home ever since.\n\nBrian holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Laramie County Community College, which he obtained in 1989. He works as a skilled mechanic at a local car repair shop in Cheyenne, earning a steady income of $52,000 per year. This income allows him to contribute to the household expenses and maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nAs a resident of Cheyenne, Brian appreciates the outdoor lifestyle Wyoming offers and often spends his free time hiking and fishing in the nearby mountains. He is a U.S. citizen by birth, born in Springfield, Illinois, and has always been proud of his American heritage.\n\nBrian's economic concerns are centered around job security and the rising cost of living in Wyoming. He is worried about the potential decline of the automotive industry and the impact of automation on his job. Additionally, he is concerned about the increasing housing costs in Cheyenne and the potential need to relocate to a more affordable area in the future.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, Brian values stability and predictability. He is a pragmatic individual who supports policies that promote local economic growth, protect American jobs, and ensure access to affordable healthcare. As a non-veteran, Brian does not have direct experience with veterans' benefits, but he strongly supports initiatives that provide assistance to veterans and their families.\n\nBrian's lack of a spouse and children means he has more disposable income, which he often uses to support local businesses and contribute to community events. He is a loyal customer of local car dealerships and advocates for policies that promote American manufacturing.\n\nAs a resident of a rural state, Brian is concerned about the availability of quality healthcare services and the need for improved infrastructure in Wyoming. He supports investments in road maintenance, public transportation, and rural broadband development to enhance the quality of life for Wyoming residents.\n\nOverall, Brian is a hardworking, practical individual who values stability, security, and community. His experiences and concerns reflect the challenges and opportunities faced by many Americans living in rural areas, and his perspectives on economic and political issues are shaped by his unique circumstances as a skilled tradesman in Wyoming."
