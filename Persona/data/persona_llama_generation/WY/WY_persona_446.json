  "PERSONA": "John, a 62-year-old White male, resides in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder of a married-couple household with kids, despite being reported as never married, suggesting a complex family situation where he may be in a long-term partnership or have taken on primary household responsibilities. \n\nAssuming John's partner has children from a previous relationship or they have adopted, this blended family structure might influence his economic and political views, particularly regarding family support policies and education. John's partner, Sarah, is a high school teacher, and they have two children, aged 16 and 18, who attend the local public high school.\n\nJohn works as an HVAC technician for a small, locally-owned business in Cheyenne, earning around $58,000 annually. His job requires him to travel across the state for installations and repairs, giving him a broad understanding of Wyoming's rural-urban divide and its implications for economic development. He has some college education but did not complete his degree, which might affect his views on higher education funding and vocational training.\n\nAs a native-born US citizen, John's birthplace is in Illinois, but he has lived in Wyoming for over 20 years. This mix of Midwestern roots and Western residence could shape his perspectives on issues like gun control, environmental policies, and the role of government in rural areas.\n\nJohn's household owns a single-family home in a moderate-income neighborhood, with a mortgage of around $1,200 per month. They also have a car loan and some credit card debt, totaling about $2,500 per month in payments. These financial responsibilities make John concerned about economic stability, job security, and access to affordable healthcare.\n\nAs the primary breadwinner, John's economic priorities include maintaining a stable income, managing household debt, and ensuring his children have access to quality education and healthcare. Politically, he is likely to support policies that promote local economic growth, improve public schools, and provide affordable healthcare options, while also being cautious about government spending and taxation."
