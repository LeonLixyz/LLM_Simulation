  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 49-year-old white woman, born in the state of Oregon but currently residing in Casper, Wyoming. She is a single mother by choice, raising two children, ages 10 and 12, as the primary household member. Despite the \"Never married\" status, she cohabits with her long-term partner, John, a 52-year-old native of Wyoming, in a household that functions as a married-couple family unit with kids.\n\nAlex has some college education, having attended a community college in Oregon for two years, where she studied early childhood education but did not complete her degree due to financial constraints. Her educational background influences her career trajectory as a preschool teacher at a local daycare center in Casper, earning an annual salary of $32,000. Her partner, John, works as a mechanic at a local car dealership, bringing home an additional $45,000 per year.\n\nThe couple rents a three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, paying $1,100 per month. They have been renting for the past five years, as they are still paying off student loans and other debts, making homeownership a distant goal.\n\nAlex's primary economic concerns include affording quality healthcare for her children, saving for their education, and managing the household expenses on their combined income. She is fluent in English, having spoken it her entire life, and has never served in the military. As a resident of Wyoming, Alex is particularly concerned about the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and its impact on local job security and environmental policies.\n\nHer daily life revolves around balancing work, parenting, and managing the household. She is actively involved in her children's school activities and volunteers at the local library's children's reading program. Alex and her partner enjoy hiking and exploring Wyoming's natural beauty during their free time."
