  "PERSONA": "Carlos Hernandez, a 57-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, currently experiencing homelessness in Casper, Wyoming. Carlos was born in Tucson, Arizona, but has been living in Wyoming for the past decade. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 1995. Despite his educational background, Carlos's economic situation has been unstable, with periods of unemployment and underemployment, leading to his current state of homelessness. He is fluent in English and has no known proficiency in Spanish, reflecting his upbringing in the US.\n\nCarlos is married but separated from his wife, who resides in a different part of the state. They have two adult children, both living independently in other states. The separation was largely due to economic stress and the challenges of finding stable employment in Wyoming's fluctuating job market. Carlos's wife works as a teacher, and their children are pursuing higher education, which has strained the family's financial resources.\n\nBefore becoming homeless, Carlos worked as a sales representative for a local outdoor gear store in Casper. However, the store closed down due to economic downturns in the energy sector, which significantly impacted the local economy. Carlos has been struggling to find a new job that matches his skills and experience, leading to a decline in his economic stability.\n\nAs a homeless individual, Carlos's primary economic concerns revolve around finding affordable housing and securing a stable income. He has been living in a local shelter and is on the waiting list for subsidized housing. Carlos's experience with homelessness has made him more aware of the need for affordable housing solutions and social services that cater to the homeless population in rural areas like Wyoming.\n\nDespite the challenges, Carlos remains hopeful about his future. He is actively seeking employment and has been taking courses at the local community college to enhance his job prospects. Carlos's educational background and work experience have equipped him with skills that could be valuable in Wyoming's emerging industries, such as tourism and renewable energy. However, his current situation makes him more likely to prioritize policies that address affordable housing, job creation, and social services for vulnerable populations."
