  "PERSONA": "Johnathon \"John\" Thompson is a 29-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Despite having a graduate degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, John has been struggling with homelessness for the past year due to unforeseen circumstances, including a job market downturn in his field and a costly divorce from his wife, Rachel, whom he married in 2018. They have a 2-year-old daughter, Emily, who lives with Rachel in a small apartment in downtown Cheyenne, and John tries to see her as often as possible.\n\nJohn's current situation is a far cry from his expectations after completing his master's degree. He had secured a well-paying job as an environmental consultant but lost it due to company restructuring. With the high cost of living and limited job opportunities in his field, John found himself unable to afford his mortgage payments and eventually lost his home.\n\nDespite these challenges, John remains optimistic and is actively seeking employment. He spends most of his days at the local library, applying for jobs, and volunteering at a nearby community garden to gain experience and build his network. He hopes to find a stable job soon and get back on his feet.\n\nJohn is fluent in English and was born in Wyoming, which he considers his home. He is a US citizen and feels strongly about environmental issues affecting his home state, particularly the impact of climate change on local wildlife and ecosystems. His economic concerns are immediate \u2013 finding stable housing and a job that pays a living wage. However, he also thinks about the long-term implications of economic policies on the environment and the community.\n\nJohn's marital status is complicated; although he and Rachel are separated and in the process of divorce, they maintain a cordial relationship for the sake of their daughter. This situation makes him acutely aware of the need for affordable housing, accessible childcare, and economic support for families in similar situations."
