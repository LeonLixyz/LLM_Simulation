  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 28-year-old white female, is the primary householder of her household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Boise, Idaho, she is a US citizen who moved to Wyoming for college and decided to stay after graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming. Emily is married but currently separated from her husband, with whom she has two children, ages 4 and 6. Her English proficiency is excellent, as it is her primary language. \n\nEmily works as a marketing specialist for a local outdoor gear company, earning approximately $52,000 annually. Her job involves creating promotional materials and managing social media campaigns, which she enjoys due to her passion for the outdoors and creative expression. She rents a three-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood near her children's school for $1,200 per month. \n\nEmily's educational background has significantly influenced her career trajectory. She chose to pursue a degree in Business Administration to secure a stable job that would allow her to support her family. Her long-term goal is to start her own business, possibly a sustainable products company, but for now, she is focused on gaining experience and building a financial safety net.\n\nAs a single mother with limited financial resources, Emily's primary economic concerns include affordable childcare, healthcare, and saving for her children's education. She is eager to see policies that address these issues and support working families. Her experience living in a relatively conservative state like Wyoming has also made her more aware of environmental issues, such as land conservation and wildlife preservation, which she feels are essential to the state's economy and her children's future."
