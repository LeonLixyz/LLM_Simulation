  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Maria Garcia, a 48-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her second husband, Juan, whom she met through mutual friends five years ago. Ana is a resident of a multi-generational household, where she lives with her husband, her 65-year-old mother, and her 22-year-old nephew, who is currently attending college. This living arrangement is a result of her mother's retirement and the need for family support, as well as her nephew's decision to pursue higher education in the state.\n\nAna was born in Casper, Wyoming, to Mexican immigrant parents who settled in the United States in the 1970s. Growing up in a bilingual household, Ana learned Spanish as her first language but has since become proficient in English, which she speaks well. She attended high school in Casper and later enrolled in a local community college, where she studied business administration for two years before dropping out due to family obligations.\n\nCurrently, Ana works as an administrative assistant at a small law firm in downtown Cheyenne, earning an annual salary of $38,000. Her job provides health insurance and a stable income, which is crucial for supporting her family. Ana's husband, Juan, is a self-employed contractor who works on various projects around the city, earning an average annual income of $50,000. Their combined income allows them to rent a modest three-bedroom house in a working-class neighborhood, with a monthly rent of $1,200.\n\nAna's economic concerns are centered around saving for her nephew's education expenses and planning for her mother's long-term care. She is also interested in purchasing a home in the near future, but the rising housing prices in Cheyenne make it challenging for her and her husband to afford a mortgage. As a result, Ana is keenly aware of local and national policies related to affordable housing, education, and healthcare, which directly impact her family's well-being."
