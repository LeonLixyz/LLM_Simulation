  "PERSONA": "Johnathan \"John\" Michael Thompson, a 49-year-old white male, is the primary householder of a married-couple household without kids in Casper, Wyoming. He was born in Bozeman, Montana, but has lived in Wyoming for over 15 years, having moved for work. John is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently, with no other languages spoken at home. He is married to his wife, Emily, whom he met in high school and married at the age of 25; they have been together for over 24 years.\n\nJohn holds a high school diploma from a public school in Bozeman and did not pursue higher education due to financial constraints and the desire to start working immediately. He began his career in the construction industry as a laborer and, through on-the-job training and certifications, worked his way up to become a construction supervisor for a local firm. His annual income is approximately $62,000, which, combined with his wife's income as a part-time librarian ($25,000/year), allows them to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nThe couple owns a modest, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, valued at around $280,000, with a mortgage that they have been paying off for the past 10 years. Their household expenses include the mortgage, utilities, two vehicles (a pickup truck for John's job and a sedan for Emily's commute), and saving for retirement.\n\nJohn's economic concerns include the rising costs of healthcare, the impact of inflation on their savings, and the potential for economic downturns affecting his job security. Politically, John leans towards conservative views, valuing small government, lower taxes, and individual freedoms. However, his experiences and Emily's influence have also made him supportive of public education and community development initiatives.\n\nIn his free time, John enjoys fishing in the nearby lakes and rivers, coaching a local Little League team, and volunteering at community events. Despite not having children of their own, John and Emily are close to their nieces and nephews and often host family gatherings. John's economic and political views are shaped by his upbringing, career, and community involvement, making him a representative voice for many middle-class Americans living in rural and suburban areas."
