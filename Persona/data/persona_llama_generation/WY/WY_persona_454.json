  "PERSONA": "Meet 69-year-old William \"Bill\" Thompson, a lifelong resident of Wyoming, living in the small town of Cody, nestled in the northwestern part of the state. Bill is a high school graduate, having attended Cody High School, where he was an average student but excelled in vocational training, particularly in mechanics. \n\nBill has been married to his wife, Margaret, for over 40 years, but they have no children together due to health issues early in their marriage. Despite this, they have a close-knit family with nieces and nephews, whom they often host during summer vacations. Margaret, 67, is a retired librarian, and her pension, combined with Bill's income, provides them with a comfortable living.\n\nBill works as a part-time mechanic at a local repair shop, earning around $35,000 per year. Prior to this, he had a successful career as a diesel mechanic for the local school district, from which he retired at 62. He continues to work part-time to stay active and contribute to the household income.\n\nThe Thompsons own a modest, single-story home in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Cody, which they purchased in 1985 for $120,000. The house has appreciated in value over the years, and it is now worth around $280,000. They have a small garden where Margaret grows herbs and vegetables, which they enjoy during the summer months.\n\nBill's economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs, as he has diabetes and Margaret has arthritis. They are enrolled in Medicare and a supplemental insurance plan, which helps cover some of the expenses, but they still worry about the rising costs of medication and potential long-term care. Bill is also concerned about the impact of tourism on the local economy and the increasing cost of living in Cody, which he feels is pricing out long-time residents.\n\nBill's political views are moderate, leaning conservative on fiscal issues and liberal on social issues. He values individual freedom, limited government intervention in personal lives, and responsible management of natural resources, reflecting the independent spirit of Wyoming. However, he also believes in the importance of social safety nets and access to quality, affordable healthcare."
