  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Carlos Hernandez, a 38-year-old Mexican-American male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He resides in a multi-generational household with his parents in a modest, single-family home in a working-class neighborhood. Juan Carlos is married to his high school sweetheart, Emily, who is of non-Hispanic white descent, and they have been married for 10 years.\n\nJuan Carlos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but his family relocated to Wyoming when he was a teenager. His parents, both immigrants from Mexico, value education and encouraged Juan Carlos to pursue higher studies. He attended Laramie County Community College, where he studied automotive technology but did not complete his degree due to family obligations.\n\nJuan Carlos works as a service manager at a local car dealership, earning an annual salary of $52,000. He is fluent in English, having learned it as his primary language in school, and often helps his Spanish-speaking parents navigate everyday tasks and official documents.\n\nAs a married man living with his parents, Juan Carlos's household dynamics are influenced by a mix of traditional and modern values. His parents, though retired, contribute to household expenses, which helps alleviate some of the financial burden on Juan Carlos and his wife. Emily works part-time as a nurse, bringing in an additional $30,000 per year. The couple is planning to start a family soon, which is a significant consideration in their financial decisions.\n\nTheir household income is around $82,000, which is slightly above the median household income in Cheyenne. However, with the rising costs of living and the prospect of starting a family, Juan Carlos is concerned about saving for the future, affording quality education, and ensuring job security. These economic concerns influence his views on policy issues, particularly those related to education, healthcare, and economic growth.\n\nJuan Carlos's experiences as a first-generation college attendee and his mixed cultural background shape his perspectives on social mobility and access to opportunities. He values education and believes in the importance of vocational training programs, having seen their impact on his own career. As a resident of Wyoming, he is also keenly aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and the need for diversification.\n\nIn his free time, Juan Carlos enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and camping, which Wyoming's natural beauty provides in abundance. He is also an avid follower of local politics and participates in community events, reflecting his interest in the well-being of his community and his desire to contribute to its growth."
