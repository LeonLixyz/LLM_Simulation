  "PERSONA": "Ana Garc\u00eda, a 38-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, is the primary householder in a cohabiting couple household with her 40-year-old husband, Carlos, in a modest, two-bedroom apartment in the downtown area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Ana moved to Wyoming seven years ago for job opportunities. She is a U.S. citizen by birth and speaks English fluently, having grown up in a bilingual household where her parents valued English proficiency for better job prospects.\n\nAna is married but does not have any children. She and Carlos met while working at a local restaurant and decided to move in together three years ago. They have been married for two years, and their decision not to have children is partly due to their focus on establishing financial stability and partly because they enjoy the freedom and spontaneity that comes with not having a family.\n\nAna has some college education, having attended the University of New Mexico for two years before moving to Wyoming. She was studying business administration but did not complete her degree due to financial constraints. Despite not having a degree, Ana has been able to secure a stable job as a sales associate at a local retail store, where she earns $38,500 annually. Her husband, Carlos, works as a mechanic at a local garage, earning $42,000 annually. Together, they have a combined income of $80,500.\n\nAna and Carlos rent their apartment for $1,200 per month, which is slightly above the average rent in Cheyenne. They have been saving to buy a house but are hesitant due to the current economic climate and the uncertainty of their jobs. Ana is the primary decision-maker in the household, handling all the finances, bills, and long-term planning.\n\nAna's economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and the rising cost of living in Cheyenne. She is particularly worried about the impact of economic downturns on her job and the potential for layoffs. Ana is also concerned about access to quality, affordable healthcare, especially since her husband has a pre-existing medical condition. She supports policies that promote job creation, affordable housing, and accessible healthcare.\n\nIn her free time, Ana enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. She is also an avid reader and enjoys cooking traditional Mexican dishes. Ana's cultural heritage plays a significant role in her life, and she values her Mexican roots, often celebrating traditional holidays and cooking family recipes."
