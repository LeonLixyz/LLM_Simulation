  "PERSONA": "John Michael Thompson, a 49-year-old white male living in Casper, Wyoming. He resides with his 75-year-old widowed mother in a single-family home in a moderately affluent suburban neighborhood, where he grew up. John's father passed away five years ago, prompting his decision to move back in with his mother to provide support and care.\n\nJohn holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Casper College, which he obtained in 1998. He works as a service manager at a local Ford dealership, earning a salary of $62,000 per year. His job involves overseeing the day-to-day operations of the service department, including managing a team of mechanics and coordinating with customers.\n\nAs a non-veteran and having never been married, John's social life revolves around his family and close friends from high school. He is fluent in English and has no other language proficiency. John's economic concerns include ensuring his mother's financial security and planning for his own retirement, which he hopes to achieve in about a decade. He prioritizes saving for his mother's potential long-term care needs and his own post-retirement lifestyle.\n\nJohn's living situation allows him to split household expenses with his mother, making his personal expenses relatively low. He owns a 2018 Ford F-150, which he purchased through his dealership's employee discount program. John's economic priorities are influenced by his moderate income, family responsibilities, and the relatively low cost of living in Wyoming. He is likely to support policies that promote economic growth, job security, and affordable healthcare, particularly for seniors and families."
