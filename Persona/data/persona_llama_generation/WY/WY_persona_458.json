  "PERSONA": "Ana Morales, a 38-year-old Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity, resides in Casper, Wyoming. She is married to her long-term partner, Alex, and they have chosen not to formalize their union through marriage. Ana holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she earned after moving to the state for graduate school. Born in Tucson, Arizona, Ana grew up in a bilingual household but now speaks English fluently and has lost some proficiency in Spanish.\n\nAna works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm, earning $62,000 annually. Her job involves assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of construction projects in the region. Her graduate education and professional experience have equipped her with a strong understanding of environmental regulations and policies, making her a valuable asset to her company.\n\nAna and her partner, Alex, rent a two-bedroom apartment in a modest neighborhood in Casper. They have chosen not to buy a home yet, prioritizing financial flexibility and the freedom to travel. Ana's economic concerns include saving for retirement, paying off her student loans, and building an emergency fund. She is particularly interested in policies that address climate change, access to affordable education, and immigration reform.\n\nAna's household is a blended one, with Alex's 10-year-old son from a previous relationship living with them part-time. This arrangement has influenced Ana's views on family policies, education, and healthcare. She values flexibility in the workplace and access to quality, affordable childcare.\n\nAna's experience as a Hispanic woman in a predominantly white state has also shaped her perspectives on diversity, equity, and inclusion. She is an active volunteer for local organizations that promote environmental education and conservation in underserved communities. Ana's economic and political views are influenced by her professional expertise, personal experiences, and commitment to social and environmental justice."
