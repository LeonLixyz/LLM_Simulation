  "PERSONA": "Alexander \"Alex\" Thompson, a 28-year-old White male, living in Casper, Wyoming. He shares a two-bedroom apartment with his partner, Emily, whom he has been in a long-term relationship with for about 5 years. They are not married but consider themselves as each other's spouse. \n\nAssuming Alex's household type is a \"Shared household with unmarried partner\" based on his marital status and household relationship, they split the rent and utilities equally. Their apartment is located in a modest neighborhood near downtown Casper, with a mix of old and new buildings.\n\nAlex works as a junior sales representative for a local outdoor gear store, earning $45,000 per year. He has been working there for about 3 years, having dropped out of Casper College after 2 years of studying business administration. Alex's lack of a degree has limited his career advancement, but he is determined to learn and grow within the company.\n\nHe was born and raised in Casper, Wyoming, and is proud of his local roots. Alex's family has lived in Wyoming for generations, and he values the close-knit community and outdoor lifestyle the state offers. His parents own a small ranch on the outskirts of Casper, where Alex often helps out on weekends.\n\nAlex's primary economic concerns are saving for a down payment on a house, paying off his student loans, and planning for his future with Emily. They hope to start a family soon and want to ensure they have a stable financial foundation. Alex is also concerned about the local economy, particularly the impact of the decline in the coal industry on Casper's job market and the state's overall economic well-being.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Alex does not have direct experience with military service, but he values the sacrifices made by those who serve and supports local veterans' organizations. His language proficiency in English is excellent, having grown up speaking it as his first language. Alex is a US citizen by birth and has never lived outside of Wyoming, which shapes his perspective on national and local issues."
