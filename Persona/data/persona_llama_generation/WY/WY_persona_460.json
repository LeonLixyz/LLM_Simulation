  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hern\u00e1ndez, an 87-year-old retired male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As a primary householder, he resides in a single-family home in a quiet, suburban neighborhood. Juan is married but currently separated from his wife, Ana, who resides in a nearby assisted living facility due to her health conditions. They have no children together, but Juan has a close relationship with his nieces and nephews who live in other parts of the country.\n\nJuan was born in New Mexico but has lived in Wyoming for over 20 years. He is a US-born citizen of Spanish descent, and although he speaks English, he prefers to communicate in Spanish, particularly when speaking with family and friends. His English proficiency is limited, which can sometimes make everyday tasks challenging, but he manages with the help of his family and local Spanish-speaking community.\n\nJuan graduated from high school in the 1950s and later pursued a career in construction, working as a carpenter for over three decades. He retired at the age of 62 and has been living off his pension and social security benefits. His annual income is around $43,000, which is sufficient for his modest lifestyle but leaves little room for discretionary spending.\n\nAs a homeowner, Juan is concerned about property taxes and the rising cost of living in Cheyenne. He is also worried about access to affordable healthcare, particularly as he ages and his health needs become more complex. Despite these concerns, Juan is grateful for the peaceful life he has built in Wyoming and values the independence that comes with living in a single-family home.\n\nJuan's economic priorities include maintaining his current standard of living, ensuring access to quality healthcare, and preserving his pension and social security benefits. Politically, he tends to support candidates who prioritize senior citizen issues, affordable healthcare, and economic stability."
