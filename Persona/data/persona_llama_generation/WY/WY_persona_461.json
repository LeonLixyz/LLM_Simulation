  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Sarah Thompson, a white, non-Hispanic female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her husband, John, a 40-year-old oil rig worker, and they have been together for over 10 years. They have two children, Emily (8) and James (5), who are both in elementary school. \n\nSarah is a high school graduate, having completed her diploma from a local school in her hometown in Nebraska before moving to Wyoming. She did not pursue higher education due to family responsibilities and personal interests. \n\nAs the spouse of the household, Sarah primarily focuses on managing the household and taking care of their children. However, she also works part-time as a receptionist at a local dental clinic, earning around $28,000 per year. Her husband's income as an oil rig worker is around $60,000 annually, making their combined household income approximately $88,000. \n\nThe Thompsons own a modest, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, which they purchased five years ago for $220,000. They have a mortgage of around $180,000, with a monthly payment of $1,200. They also have a car loan for their 2018 Honda Pilot, which they purchased for $35,000 and have been paying off at $500 per month. \n\nSarah speaks English fluently and has no known ancestry other than her American heritage, given her birth in the United States and her family's long-standing presence in the country. She is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. \n\nGiven their economic situation, Sarah's primary concerns are related to job security, especially with the fluctuations in the oil industry affecting her husband's job, and the increasing costs of healthcare and education for their children. She also worries about the impact of local economic development projects on their community and the environment."
