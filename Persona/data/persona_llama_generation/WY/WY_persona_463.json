  "PERSONA": "William \"Bill\" Thompson, a 62-year-old white male, lives with his aging parents in a rural town in Wyoming. Born in Montana, Bill moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age and has been a resident of the state for over four decades. He is a US citizen, speaks English fluently, and has never married. Bill's living situation is unique, as he resides with his parents due to their increasing need for care and assistance, a decision he made after his father's health began to decline.\n\nBill's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied automotive repair, but he did not complete his degree. He has worked as a mechanic in a local garage for over 30 years, earning a stable income of around $55,000 per year. Although his income is modest, it allows him to support himself and contribute to his parents' living expenses.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Bill does not receive any military benefits, but he does have health insurance through his employer. He rents a small apartment within his parents' property, which is a rural homestead that has been in the family for generations. The arrangement helps reduce his living expenses, allowing him to save for his own retirement and support his parents' care.\n\nGiven his situation, Bill's economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs, particularly as his parents age and require more medical attention. He is also worried about the impact of inflation on his fixed income and the rising costs of living in rural Wyoming. Politically, Bill is likely to support policies that address these concerns, such as affordable healthcare, social security, and economic development in rural areas. His experience living in a small town also makes him appreciate the importance of community and local businesses, influencing his views on economic development and job creation."
