  "PERSONA": "Meet Margaret \"Peg\" Thompson, a 68-year-old white female living in a small town in Wyoming. She is the primary householder and has been married to her husband, John, for 42 years. They moved to Wyoming 15 years ago from California, where Peg was born and raised, to enjoy a quieter lifestyle and be closer to nature. \n\nPeg's educational background includes two years of community college, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree due to starting a family and work commitments. She has been employed as an administrative assistant for a local insurance company in Wyoming for the past 10 years, earning an annual salary of $38,000. Her husband, John, is a 70-year-old retired mechanic who worked for a local garage before opening his own small repair shop, which he ran for 10 years before retiring. He currently earns a modest pension of $25,000 per year.\n\nThe couple owns a modest single-family home in a rural area outside the town of Cody, Wyoming, which they purchased for $180,000 in 2008. They have no children together but have two nieces and a nephew from John's side of the family who live in the nearby town of Powell.\n\nPeg is fluent in English and speaks it well, having been born and raised in the United States. She is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. \n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Peg is concerned about the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and the impact of economic downturns on local businesses. Her primary economic concerns include maintaining a stable retirement income, managing healthcare costs, and ensuring that her property taxes do not increase significantly. She and her husband are conservative in their spending habits, prioritize saving, and support local businesses whenever possible.\n\nPeg's political views are moderate, leaning slightly conservative. She values individual freedom, limited government intervention in personal matters, and responsible resource management. She is active in local community events, volunteers at the local animal shelter, and participates in town hall meetings to stay informed about local issues."
