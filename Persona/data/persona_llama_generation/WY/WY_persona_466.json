  "PERSONA": "Emily Thompson, a 68-year-old White female living in the town of Jackson, Wyoming. She is a widow who resides with her 45-year-old son, Michael, who is divorced and has two children of his own, ages 10 and 12. Emily's late husband, John, was a retired mechanic who passed away five years ago due to a long illness. Emily's household is a multi-generational one, with her son and his children making up the rest of the household.\n\nEmily's educational background includes completing the 11th grade at Jackson Hole High School but not receiving a diploma due to family obligations that required her to drop out and work. Despite this, she has always valued education and encouraged her son to pursue higher education. Michael holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming and works as an environmental consultant for a local firm.\n\nEmily has lived in Wyoming her entire life and has strong ties to the community. She was born in the town of Cody but moved to Jackson with her family at a young age. She has worked various part-time jobs throughout her life, including as a waitress and a retail sales associate, but has been retired since her husband's passing. Her monthly income consists of her late husband's pension, amounting to $1,800, and $1,200 from Social Security.\n\nThe household owns a modest, three-bedroom single-family home in a mixed neighborhood with a mix of older and newer homes. The house was purchased by Emily and her husband in 1995 for $120,000, and its current value is approximately $350,000. Emily's son contributes $800 monthly towards household expenses, including the mortgage, utilities, and groceries.\n\nEmily's economic concerns include managing her retirement income to ensure she can continue to support her son and grandchildren, as well as dealing with rising healthcare costs. She is also worried about the impact of Wyoming's economic fluctuations, particularly in the energy sector, on her son's job security. Politically, Emily tends to lean conservative but is open to liberal views on issues like education and environmental protection."
