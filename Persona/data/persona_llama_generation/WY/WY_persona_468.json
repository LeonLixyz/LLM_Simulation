  "PERSONA": "Juan Hernandez, a 78-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, is the primary householder in a married-couple household without children. Born in the United States, specifically in Wyoming, Juan has lived in the state his entire life, currently residing in a suburban area of Cheyenne, the state capital. Juan is a US citizen who speaks English fluently, having never spoken Spanish at home. He shares his home with his 75-year-old wife, Maria, whom he married in 1969. They have been married for 53 years and have no children together.\n\nJuan's educational background includes an Associate's degree in Mechanical Engineering, which he earned from Laramie County Community College in 1967. This degree led to his career as a mechanical engineer at a local manufacturing plant, where he worked for 32 years before retiring in 2003. His annual retirement income is $43,000, supplemented by his wife's Social Security benefits. They own their home, a single-family residence valued at $220,000, with a mortgage paid off in 2001.\n\nJuan and Maria's household income is $60,000, placing them in a relatively stable financial situation. However, they are concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of economic downturns on their retirement savings. As a result, they prioritize fiscal conservatism and are cautious about government spending. Their economic concerns are also influenced by their experience living in Wyoming, where the economy is heavily reliant on the energy industry, making them sensitive to fluctuations in the oil and gas market.\n\nGiven their life experience and economic situation, Juan and Maria tend to lean conservative in their political views, valuing self-reliance and limited government intervention in economic matters. However, their concern for healthcare and social security also makes them open to policies that protect these benefits for retirees."
