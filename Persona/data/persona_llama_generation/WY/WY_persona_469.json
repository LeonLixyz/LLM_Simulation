  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 57-year-old white female, born in Oregon but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder in a married-couple household without kids, living with her husband, Michael, whom she married 30 years ago. Alex holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Oregon, which she completed in 1989. \n\nAssuming Alex moved to Wyoming for career or personal reasons, she has been living in the state for about 20 years, developing a strong connection to the local community. Given her educational background, Alex works as an Environmental Consultant for a private firm specializing in sustainable development projects, earning a salary of $83,000 per year. Her job involves frequent travel across the state, assessing the environmental impact of various projects and ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations.\n\nAs a homeowner, Alex and her husband own a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, valued at approximately $340,000. Their mortgage payments are around $1,800 per month, with about 15 years left on their 30-year mortgage. They also have a combined savings of around $120,000, allocated between a 401(k) and a joint savings account.\n\nAlex's primary economic concerns include the rising costs of healthcare, especially as she and her husband approach retirement age, and the impact of climate change on local ecosystems and the economy. She is also concerned about the availability of well-paying jobs in Wyoming, as she has seen younger family members struggle to find employment in the state.\n\nPolitically, Alex is likely to support policies that address environmental conservation, sustainable development, and access to affordable healthcare. Her background in environmental science and experience as a consultant have instilled in her a strong appreciation for evidence-based decision-making and a commitment to preserving Wyoming's natural beauty for future generations."
