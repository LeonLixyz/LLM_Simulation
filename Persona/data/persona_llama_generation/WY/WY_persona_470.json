  "PERSONA": "Meet Harold Thompson, a 69-year-old White male who resides in a rural area of Wyoming. Harold lives with his 92-year-old mother, Margaret, in the same house where he grew up, in the small town of Cody, Wyoming. He never married and has dedicated his life to caring for his mother, who suffers from dementia.\n\nHarold's education consists of two years of community college, where he studied business administration but did not obtain a degree. This background in business has been useful in helping him manage his mother's finances and the family's property. Harold's primary source of income is a modest monthly Social Security check of $1,800 and a part-time job as a handyman for local residents, earning an additional $1,000 per month.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of Wyoming, Harold is deeply rooted in the community and has strong ties to the local culture. He speaks English fluently and has never required any additional language assistance. Born in California but raised in Wyoming, Harold has a unique perspective on the American West, valuing independence, self-reliance, and the preservation of natural beauty.\n\nHarold's economic concerns are centered around affording his mother's medical care and ensuring they can maintain their family home, which they own outright. The property, valued at $250,000, has been in the family for three generations and holds significant emotional and financial value. Harold is keenly aware of the rising costs of living in rural areas and the challenges faced by seniors in accessing healthcare services.\n\nPolitically, Harold tends to lean conservative, prioritizing local issues such as land management, access to healthcare, and support for small businesses. He is particularly interested in policies that benefit rural communities and seniors, such as expanded Medicare coverage and initiatives to address the shortage of medical professionals in rural areas."
