  "PERSONA": "Meet 49-year-old Takoda Little Deer, a married, American Indian and Alaska Native male of Aztec ethnicity, residing in the state of Wyoming. Takoda lives with his parents in a multi-generational household in the suburban town of Riverton, within the Wind River Indian Reservation. His parents, both retired from the local school district, own the home they live in, which has been in their family for generations.\n\nTakoda is married to his wife, Maya, who works as a nurse at the local hospital. They met in college but did not finish their degrees due to financial constraints. Takoda has some college credits in environmental science but works as a skilled mechanic at a local auto repair shop, earning approximately $43,000 annually. Maya's income from nursing supplements their household income, bringing their combined annual income to around $73,000.\n\nTheir household is a blend of traditional and modern practices. Takoda's parents, who are fluent in their native language, have taught him and Maya some of their ancestral traditions. However, Takoda and Maya speak English at home, which they consider their primary language. Takoda is well-versed in English, having grown up speaking it as his first language.\n\nTakoda and Maya have two children, a 12-year-old son named Kanaq, and a 9-year-old daughter named Akira. Both children attend the local public school and are involved in extracurricular activities such as sports and traditional dance. Takoda is actively involved in his children's education and often volunteers at school events.\n\nGiven his situation, Takoda's primary economic concerns include saving for his children's education, ensuring his family's access to quality healthcare, and addressing the rising cost of living in their community. He is also passionate about environmental issues affecting his reservation, such as access to clean water and the preservation of native lands. Takoda's economic priorities are centered around securing a stable financial future for his family while preserving their cultural heritage and contributing to the well-being of their community."
