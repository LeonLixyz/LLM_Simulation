  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson is a 38-year-old white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides with her parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, where she has moved back after living independently for several years. Alex's parents, both in their early sixties, are retired and own the home, which has been in the family for over two decades.\n\nAlex has never been married and does not have any children. She graduated from a local high school in Cheyenne and did not pursue higher education due to financial constraints and a desire to enter the workforce early. She has been working as a dental assistant at a private dental clinic in Cheyenne for the past five years, earning an annual salary of $42,000. Her job provides her with health insurance and a stable income, but she often finds herself living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nBorn in Denver, Colorado, Alex moved to Wyoming with her family at the age of 10. She has been a US citizen since birth and speaks only English. Despite not being fluent in any other language, Alex has taken a few online courses to learn basic Spanish, which she finds useful in communicating with some of her patients at the dental clinic.\n\nAlex's economic concerns include saving for her own place, paying off her outstanding student loans (approximately $15,000), and planning for retirement. She is also worried about her parents' health and potential long-term care needs, as they are aging and may require her support in the future. Given her financial situation and family responsibilities, Alex is likely to prioritize economic policies that focus on affordable healthcare, education, and housing."
