  "PERSONA": "Emily Johnson, a 69-year-old woman, lives with her parents in a rural town in Wyoming. She identifies as White and Some Other Race, reflecting her mixed heritage from her mother's side, who had Native American ancestry. Emily is married but her husband is currently away, working as a seasonal worker in the oil fields of North Dakota. They maintain a long-distance relationship due to the economic necessity of his job.\n\nEmily's educational background consists of a high school diploma from the local high school in her hometown of Cody, Wyoming. After high school, she worked various jobs, including as a waitress and a retail clerk, but never pursued higher education due to family obligations. She has always been fluent in English, having been born and raised in the United States.\n\nEmily's household is a multigenerational one, with her parents, aged 92 and 94, living with her. This arrangement allows her to care for them while also receiving some financial support from her husband. The household income is modest, with Emily's husband earning around $45,000 per year, and Emily contributing an additional $15,000 from her part-time job at a local caf\u00e9. They own their home, which has been in the family for decades, and have no mortgage payments.\n\nEmily's economic concerns are centered around healthcare and social security, given her age and her parents' advanced age. She is keenly aware of the rising costs of healthcare and the potential strain on their household budget. She is also concerned about the long-term sustainability of social security and the impact of any potential changes on her retirement plans. Politically, Emily tends to vote conservatively, prioritizing economic stability and traditional values, but her experiences as a caregiver for her aging parents have also made her more empathetic to the need for robust social safety nets."
