  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 29-year-old white female and primary householder living in a small, one-bedroom apartment in downtown Casper, Wyoming. She has never been married and does not have any children. As a veteran, Alex served four years in the US Army as a logistics specialist, where she developed strong organizational skills and attention to detail. After her service, she utilized the GI Bill to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, graduating with honors in 2019.\n\nCurrently, Alex works as a supply chain coordinator for a medium-sized oil and gas company in Casper, earning an annual salary of $52,000. She is responsible for managing inventory, coordinating shipments, and ensuring compliance with company regulations. Her job requires strong communication skills, analytical thinking, and the ability to work under pressure.\n\nAlex was born and raised in Wyoming, specifically in the small town of Lander, where she developed a strong sense of community and self-reliance. She moved to Casper after college to pursue better job opportunities and be closer to her family. As a homeowner is not feasible on her current salary, she rents her apartment for $850 per month, which is relatively affordable given the local market.\n\nAs a single person with no dependents, Alex's primary economic concerns are saving for a down payment on a house, paying off her student loans, and building an emergency fund. She is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to affordable housing, veterans' services, and the economic development of rural Wyoming. Alex is a registered voter and actively participates in local elections, often volunteering for campaigns that align with her values.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking, camping, and exploring the natural beauty of Wyoming. She is an avid reader and participates in a local book club, where she engages in discussions on politics, history, and social issues. As a veteran, Alex is also involved with local veterans' organizations, where she connects with fellow veterans and advocates for their rights and benefits."
