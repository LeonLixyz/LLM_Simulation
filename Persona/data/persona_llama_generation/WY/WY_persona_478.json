  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Elena Garcia is a 28-year-old, US-born Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity. She resides in Casper, Wyoming, where she is the primary householder of a rented, one-bedroom apartment in a modest, downtown neighborhood. Alex is divorced and lives alone, having separated from her high school sweetheart two years ago after a five-year marriage. \n\nShe holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2019. Following her graduation, Alex secured a job as an Environmental Consultant at a local firm, where she currently earns an annual salary of $52,000. Her role involves assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of various construction projects across the state.\n\nAs a single individual without dependents, Alex's monthly expenses are relatively manageable. She allocates 30% of her income towards rent, 20% towards saving for a future down payment on a house, and the remainder towards living expenses, student loan repayments, and leisure activities. Her financial priorities include building an emergency fund, paying off her student loans, and eventually purchasing a home in the suburbs.\n\nDespite her stable financial situation, Alex is concerned about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing housing costs and the impact of inflation on her savings. She is also passionate about environmental conservation and is keenly interested in local policies that promote sustainability and protect Wyoming's natural resources. \n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking in the nearby mountains, practicing yoga, and volunteering for local environmental initiatives. She is fluent in English and identifies as a US citizen, having been born in California but raised in Wyoming from a young age."
