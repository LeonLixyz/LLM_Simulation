  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 28-year-old white female, born in Oregon but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with her parents. She is a non-veteran, never married, and speaks only English fluently.\n\nEmily holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed two years ago. She works as a Sustainability Consultant for a local firm in Cheyenne, earning an annual salary of $55,000. Her job involves assessing and implementing environmentally friendly practices for businesses in the region.\n\nEmily's parents, both retired, own a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, where Emily resides. The house, valued at approximately $280,000, has been in the family for over a decade. Emily contributes $500 monthly towards the household expenses, which helps with utilities, groceries, and other shared costs.\n\nAs a child living with her parents, Emily's economic concerns are somewhat alleviated, allowing her to focus on her career and personal interests. However, she is keenly aware of the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly housing, and is saving to eventually move into her own place. Her priorities include affordable housing options, access to quality healthcare, and policies supporting environmental conservation, which aligns with her professional interests and values.\n\nEmily's educational background and career have instilled in her a strong appreciation for scientific research and data-driven decision-making. She is an avid follower of local and national news, often participating in online forums and discussions on environmental policy and sustainability initiatives. Her graduate degree has also equipped her with analytical skills, which she applies to evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of policy proposals.\n\nDespite her comfortable living situation, Emily is mindful of the economic challenges faced by many in her community, particularly those in rural areas. She volunteers at a local non-profit focused on promoting sustainable agriculture and renewable energy, reflecting her commitment to creating positive change in her community."
