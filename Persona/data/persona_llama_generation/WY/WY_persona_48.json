  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 22-year-old male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder of a single-person household and has never been married. Ethan was born in Wyoming and is a US citizen. He speaks English fluently and has a high school diploma from Cheyenne East High School, which he obtained in 2019.\n\nEthan works as an HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) technician, a job that falls under the category of installation, maintenance, and repair occupations. He has been employed by a local company, Mountain Air Services, for about two years and earns an annual salary of $85,000. Despite his relatively high income, Ethan does not have health insurance coverage, which is a concern for him, especially given the physically demanding nature of his job.\n\nEthan rents a one-bedroom apartment in a modest neighborhood in Cheyenne for $900 per month. He has a car loan for his 2018 Ford F-150, which he uses for work and personal trips. His monthly expenses include $350 for the car loan, $150 for phone and internet services, and $500 for groceries and entertainment.\n\nGiven his economic situation, Ethan's primary concerns are related to financial security and access to healthcare. He is interested in policies that address the rising costs of healthcare and promote affordable insurance options. He also supports initiatives that encourage economic growth in Wyoming, particularly in the energy and manufacturing sectors, which could lead to more job opportunities and higher wages.\n\nEthan's educational background has influenced his career trajectory, as he chose a vocational path that allowed him to enter the workforce immediately after high school. He values the hands-on skills he acquired through his job training and appreciates the stability and decent income that come with his occupation.\n\nAs a young adult without dependents, Ethan's family structure is relatively simple, with no immediate responsibilities beyond himself. However, he is close to his parents, who live in a nearby town, and visits them regularly.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Ethan is aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and the potential risks associated with it. He is interested in diversifying the local economy and promoting sustainable development, which he believes would benefit the community and his own economic prospects in the long run."
