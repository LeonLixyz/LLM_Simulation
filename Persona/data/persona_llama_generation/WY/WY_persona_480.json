  "PERSONA": "Meet Maria Elena Gonzales, a 68-year-old Aztec woman living in Casper, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of a modest, single-family home in a mixed-income neighborhood near downtown Casper, where she has resided for over 20 years. Maria is divorced, having separated from her husband about a decade ago, and does not have any children. She shares her home with her younger sister, who helps with household chores and provides companionship.\n\nMaria is a high school graduate of Natrona County High School in Casper, Wyoming, where she grew up. After completing her education, she worked as an administrative assistant in various local offices, including a stint at the Casper City Hall. Currently, she is semi-retired, working part-time as a receptionist at a small, family-owned dental clinic in Casper. Her annual income is approximately $35,000, supplemented by a modest pension from her previous full-time employment.\n\nAs a homeowner, Maria is proud of her property, which she purchased with her ex-husband in the early 1990s. The mortgage is fully paid off, and the property's value has appreciated over the years. However, Maria is concerned about the rising property taxes and maintenance costs, which sometimes strain her fixed income.\n\nMaria's economic priorities include managing her finances carefully to ensure a comfortable retirement, maintaining her home, and supporting her sister, who is dealing with health issues. She is also interested in local politics, particularly issues related to education, healthcare, and environmental conservation. Maria is a registered voter and actively participates in local elections, often volunteering at polling stations.\n\nIn her free time, Maria enjoys gardening, cooking traditional Aztec dishes, and attending cultural events at the Casper College's Humanities Festival. She is fluent in English and has a strong sense of community, often participating in local charity events and volunteering at the Casper Food Bank.\n\nAssumptions made based on the metadata include:\n\n- Maria's exact age (68) within the provided range (65-74 years)\n- Her specific job title (receptionist) and sector (healthcare) based on common occupations for high school graduates\n- The assumption that Maria's sister is younger and lives with her, given the household type (Married-couple Without kids) and Maria's marital status (Divorced)\n- Maria's annual income ($35,000) and pension, which are reasonable estimates for a semi-retired, part-time worker in Wyoming\n- The specific location (Casper, Wyoming) within the state, given its relatively large population and economic hub status."
