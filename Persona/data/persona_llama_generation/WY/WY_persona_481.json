  "PERSONA": "Meet Emily Wong, a 22-year-old white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her husband, Alex, a software engineer, but since they got married recently, she still maintains her maiden name for professional purposes. Emily is a non-veteran and was born in California, but she has lived in Wyoming for the past four years. She is a U.S. citizen by birth and speaks fluent English, having grown up in an English-speaking household despite her parents being immigrants who speak Tagalog at home.\n\nEmily holds a master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in two years after earning her undergraduate degree in Biology from the University of California, Berkeley. Her educational background has equipped her with a strong foundation in research and analysis, skills she now applies in her job as a Climate Change Analyst at a local non-profit organization focused on sustainability. Her annual salary is around $55,000, and she works remotely from home two days a week.\n\nEmily and her husband rent a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Cheyenne for $1,200 per month. They do not have children yet but are planning to start a family in the next few years. Emily's husband earns a higher income as a software engineer, around $90,000 per year, which allows them to live comfortably and save for their future. They are considering buying a house in the next two years, but for now, they are happy with their current lifestyle.\n\nEmily's economic concerns include rising housing costs, student loan debt (she owes around $30,000 from her graduate program), and the impact of climate change on local communities. She is also interested in policies that support renewable energy, affordable housing, and education. Her experiences as a young professional and a recent transplant to Wyoming have given her a unique perspective on the state's economic and environmental challenges, and she is eager to contribute to the conversation through her work and community engagement."
