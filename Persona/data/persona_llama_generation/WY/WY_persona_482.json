  "PERSONA": "Meet 49-year-old Ryan Thompson, a white male living in Casper, Wyoming. Ryan is a veteran who has never been married and currently resides with his parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood. His parents own the home, which has been in the family for over 20 years. Ryan's decision to live with his parents stems from a combination of factors, including his veteran status and the challenges he faced reintegrating into civilian life after serving in the military.\n\nRyan was born in Colorado but has lived in Wyoming for most of his life. He attended Casper College for two years, studying mechanical engineering, but did not complete his degree due to financial constraints. Despite not having a college degree, Ryan has managed to secure a relatively stable job as a mechanic at a local car repair shop, earning an annual salary of $52,000.\n\nAs a veteran, Ryan has access to certain benefits, including healthcare and education assistance. However, he has struggled to find a job that matches his skills and experience, leading to feelings of frustration and disillusionment with the job market. Ryan's economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and the rising cost of living in Wyoming.\n\nRyan's family situation is relatively simple, with his parents being his primary support system. He has no children of his own and has never been married. His social life is limited, but he is close to his parents and a few friends from his military days. Ryan's veteran status and experiences have shaped his views on politics, with a strong emphasis on supporting fellow veterans and ensuring that the government provides adequate resources for those who have served.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, Ryan is concerned about the impact of inflation on his daily life, the affordability of healthcare, and the need for better job opportunities in Wyoming. He is skeptical of government programs but believes that certain initiatives, such as vocational training and small business loans, could help improve the local economy. Ryan's views on politics are moderate, with a slight lean towards conservative policies, particularly when it comes to national security and veterans' affairs."
