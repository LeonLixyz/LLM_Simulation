  "PERSONA": "Maria Elena Hernandez is a 49-year-old Mexican-American woman living in Casper, Wyoming. She has been married to her husband, Juan, for over 20 years, but they are currently separated due to his work as a truck driver, which keeps him on the road for most of the year. Maria is the primary householder of a single-family, one-story home in a working-class neighborhood in Casper, which she rents for $800 per month. She was born in Arizona but moved to Wyoming 15 years ago to be closer to her family.\n\nMaria attended high school in Arizona but dropped out in the 11th grade to work and support her family. She has since obtained her GED and has been working as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance agency in Casper, earning $28,000 per year. Maria is fluent in English and has no proficiency in Spanish, as she was raised in an English-speaking household.\n\nMaria's economic concerns are centered around affording healthcare and saving for retirement. She has been struggling to make ends meet, as her income is barely enough to cover her living expenses, including rent, utilities, and groceries. She is worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the impact it may have on her ability to afford medical care in the future. As a result, Maria is likely to prioritize policies that address affordable healthcare and economic stability for low-income households.\n\nDespite her economic challenges, Maria is proud of her independence and resourcefulness. She is an avid reader and enjoys volunteering at the local animal shelter in her free time. She is also an active member of her community, participating in neighborhood potlucks and attending city council meetings to stay informed about local issues. Maria's experiences and concerns shape her views on economic and political policies, making her a unique and valuable voice in her community."
