  "PERSONA": "Emily Thompson, a 78-year-old white female, born in Illinois but currently residing in a rural area near Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital. She has been married for over 50 years to her high school sweetheart, John, who is now retired. Despite being married, they live separately due to John's health issues, which require him to stay in a nearby assisted living facility. Emily is the primary householder of their rural home, which they own outright, having paid off the mortgage years ago.\n\nEmily graduated from high school in Illinois and did not pursue higher education due to family obligations and the societal norms of her time. She worked as a part-time librarian for over two decades before retiring at the age of 65. Her income consists of her husband's pension, her own retirement savings, and a small amount from social security, totaling around $45,000 annually.\n\nEmily's primary concerns are healthcare and the rising cost of living, especially in her rural area where access to services can be limited. She is fluent in English and has no proficiency in any other language. Emily is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. Her economic situation allows her to live comfortably but not extravagantly, with her main priority being ensuring her husband receives the best care possible.\n\nEmily's lifestyle is quiet, with most of her social interactions happening at the local church and community events. She values independence and self-sufficiency, reflecting the ethos of her rural community. Despite the challenges of aging and living apart from her husband, Emily remains optimistic, focusing on her gardening and volunteering at the local animal shelter to stay engaged and active."
