  "PERSONA": "Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male, lives with his parents in a small suburban town in Wyoming, specifically in the city of Casper. Ryan is married but has been separated from his wife for about a year, and they are currently undergoing divorce proceedings. They have no children together. Ryan's parents own the home, a modest single-family house on the outskirts of town, where Ryan contributes to the household expenses by paying a small monthly rent.\n\nRyan's highest level of education is 11th grade, which he completed at Natrona County High School in Casper. He dropped out before his senior year due to financial difficulties at home and the need to support his family by taking on a full-time job. This decision has significantly impacted his career trajectory, limiting his job opportunities and earning potential.\n\nRyan works as a sales associate at a local auto parts store, earning around $32,000 per year. His job is stable, but the pay is modest, and he often has to work overtime to make ends meet. He has been in this role for about five years, having started as a part-time worker and gradually moving to full-time.\n\nGiven his economic situation, Ryan's primary concerns are financial stability and job security. He is deeply concerned about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing prices of housing and healthcare. He feels that the current economic policies do not adequately address the needs of working-class individuals like himself, who struggle to afford basic necessities.\n\nRyan's marital situation and living arrangement also significantly influence his economic views. He believes that the government should provide more support for families and individuals going through divorce, particularly in terms of counseling services and financial assistance. He also advocates for policies that help young adults achieve financial independence from their parents, such as affordable housing initiatives and job training programs.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ryan is deeply invested in the state's economy, which is heavily reliant on the energy industry. He supports policies that promote sustainable energy development and job creation in the sector, while also ensuring environmental protection. Ryan's experiences and concerns make him a vocal advocate for economic policies that address the needs of working-class Americans and promote financial stability and security."
