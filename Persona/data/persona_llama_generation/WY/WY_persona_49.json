  "PERSONA": "John Anderson, a 49-year-old white male, is the primary householder of his single-person household in a small apartment in downtown Casper, Wyoming. He is married but currently separated from his wife due to work-related relocation issues. Born in Montana, John is a US citizen and speaks English fluently. \n\nJohn holds a high school diploma from his hometown in Montana and moved to Wyoming for better job opportunities. He has been working in production occupations for over 15 years, currently employed as a production supervisor at a local oil refinery, earning $29,500 annually. His job provides him with private health insurance, which he values highly.\n\nJohn's primary economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Casper and the fluctuations in the oil industry, which impact his job security. As a result, he has been considering furthering his education through vocational training to enhance his career prospects and increase his earning potential. He is particularly interested in programs that focus on renewable energy, given the growing importance of the sector in Wyoming.\n\nJohn's daily commute is about 30 minutes, and he spends his free time reading about local politics and economic development in the region. He is an avid supporter of local businesses and believes in the importance of community development initiatives. John's current living situation, though modest, allows him to save some money, which he hopes to use for a down payment on a house in the near future.\n\nAs a separated individual, John's social life is relatively quiet, with most of his interactions being work-related or through his online community forums where he discusses local economic issues and policy changes. Despite the challenges, John remains optimistic about his future in Casper and is eager to contribute to the local community through his work and civic engagement."
