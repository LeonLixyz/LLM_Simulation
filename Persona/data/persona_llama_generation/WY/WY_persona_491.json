  "PERSONA": "Alexandra 'Alex' Thompson, a 38-year-old divorced female, is the primary householder of her single-person household in Casper, Wyoming. Born in Bozeman, Montana, she has been a US citizen by birth and identifies as White. She is fluent in English and has a graduate degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming.\n\nProfessionally, Alex works as an Environmental Consultant for a private firm in Casper, specializing in sustainability and green technology. Her annual income is around $73,000, placing her in a relatively stable economic situation. She has been working in her current role for about 5 years, after spending 3 years working for the state government in a similar capacity.\n\nAlex owns a modest single-family home in the downtown area of Casper, which she purchased 4 years ago for $220,000. Her monthly mortgage payments are around $1,400, and she spends an additional $150 on property taxes. She has a car loan for her 2018 Subaru Outback, which costs her around $350 per month.\n\nAs a single person, Alex's household expenses are relatively low, allowing her to save around 15% of her income each month. Her primary economic concerns are related to the rising costs of living in Wyoming, especially the increasing property taxes, and the impact of national environmental policies on her work and local community.\n\nDespite being divorced, Alex maintains a close relationship with her ex-husband, with whom she shares no children. She values her independence and enjoys the freedom to pursue her hobbies, such as hiking and wildlife photography. Alex's educational background and career trajectory have significantly influenced her views on environmental issues and economic development, often finding herself at the intersection of economic growth and sustainability."
