  "PERSONA": "Robert \"Bob\" Thompson, a 69-year-old white male, resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with his wife, Margaret, in a single-family home they own in a suburban neighborhood near the city's outskirts. They have been married for 43 years and have no children. Born and raised in Wyoming, Bob is a US citizen who speaks English fluently and has an associate's degree in automotive technology from Laramie County Community College.\n\nBob works part-time as a service manager at a local Ford dealership, earning approximately $55,000 annually. Prior to this, he spent 25 years working as a mechanic and later as a shop foreman at a now-defunct Chevrolet dealership. His current position allows him to utilize his experience while enjoying a better work-life balance.\n\nMargaret, 67, is a retired elementary school teacher who worked for the Laramie County School District for 32 years. Her pension and Bob's part-time income provide a comfortable living, enabling them to enjoy retirement activities such as fishing, hiking, and traveling within the US.\n\nTheir primary residence is a 2,200 sq. ft. single-story home in a well-maintained neighborhood with a mix of older and newer homes. They purchased the property in 1995 for $120,000 and have since made several renovations, increasing its value to around $280,000.\n\nAs a homeowner, Bob is concerned about property taxes and their potential impact on his fixed income. He is also interested in local economic development, particularly initiatives that support small businesses and promote tourism in the Cheyenne area.\n\nBob's economic priorities include maintaining a stable cost of living, ensuring access to quality healthcare, and preserving Wyoming's natural beauty. He follows local news and is active in his community, participating in neighborhood association meetings and voting in local elections."
