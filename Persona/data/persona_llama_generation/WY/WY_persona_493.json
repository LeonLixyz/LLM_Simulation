  "PERSONA": "Maria Rodriguez, a 69-year-old, non-citizen, white female, originally from Costa Rica, residing with her 70-year-old husband, Juan, in a two-bedroom apartment in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood in Casper, Wyoming. Maria's household also includes her 45-year-old daughter, Sofia, who is currently between jobs and living with her parents due to financial difficulties. Maria's husband, Juan, works as a part-time janitor, earning approximately $25,000 annually, while Maria's annual income is around $18,000 from her part-time job as a waitress at a local diner.\n\nMaria has some college education, having attended a local community college in Costa Rica for two years before dropping out to get married and start a family. Her English proficiency is good, which she developed through English language courses and years of interacting with English-speaking customers at the diner.\n\nMaria and her family rent their apartment for $800 per month, which is a significant expense considering their combined income. They rely on Medicaid for healthcare, as neither Maria's nor Juan's jobs offer health insurance. The family's economic situation is precarious, with their combined income barely covering essential expenses, including rent, utilities, groceries, and transportation costs.\n\nMaria's primary economic concerns are affording healthcare, saving for retirement, and ensuring her daughter finds stable employment. She worries about the impact of potential policy changes on her family's access to Medicaid and the overall affordability of living in the United States. Despite these concerns, Maria remains hopeful for her family's future, particularly her daughter's, and is eager to see policies that support low-income families and promote economic mobility."
