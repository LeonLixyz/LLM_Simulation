  "PERSONA": "John Thompson is a 62-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with his wife in his parents' household. Born in Denver, Colorado, John moved to Wyoming 20 years ago for a job opportunity. \n\nAssuming the missing household type, given John's marital status and household relationship, it's reasonable to infer that he and his wife live in a multi-generational household with his aging parents, possibly due to financial constraints or a desire to care for his parents.\n\nJohn holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he earned after serving in the US Army for six years. His military experience has influenced his views on national security and veterans' welfare. He is now employed as a middle manager in the state government sector, earning a modest income of around $65,000 per year.\n\nAs a married man with no dependents of his own, John's economic concerns focus on ensuring a comfortable retirement for himself and his wife, as well as supporting his aging parents. His wife, a part-time teacher, contributes to their household income. They rent the top floor of his parents' two-story house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, paying $800 per month.\n\nJohn's educational background has significantly impacted his career trajectory, allowing him to secure stable employment in the state government sector. His experience in the military has also shaped his views on politics, particularly in regards to veterans' rights and national defense. John is a US citizen, born and raised in the United States, and speaks English fluently.\n\nJohn's economic priorities include maintaining a stable income, saving for retirement, and ensuring access to quality healthcare for his parents. His experience living in a multi-generational household has also made him more aware of the need for affordable housing and elder care services."
