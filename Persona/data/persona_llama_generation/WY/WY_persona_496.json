  "PERSONA": "Meet Carlos Hernandez, a 79-year-old male, who lives with his wife, Maria, in a small, single-story house in the suburbs of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in New Mexico, Carlos grew up in a Spanish-speaking household and, although he speaks English well, Spanish remains his primary language. He has been married to Maria for 55 years, and they have no children.\n\nCarlos holds a 7th-grade education, which he completed before dropping out to work and support his family. He worked as a ranch hand for most of his life, eventually owning a small ranch that he managed with his wife until his retirement 15 years ago. As the primary householder, Carlos takes pride in having provided for his family and being able to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nCarlos and Maria have lived in Wyoming for over 30 years, having moved there for better job opportunities and a more peaceful life. They own their home, which is valued at around $250,000, and have a mortgage that they are close to paying off. Their annual household income is approximately $45,000, mostly consisting of Carlos's pension and Maria's part-time work as a seamstress.\n\nGiven his background and current situation, Carlos is concerned about the rising cost of living, particularly healthcare and property taxes, which he believes are becoming increasingly unaffordable for seniors like himself. He is also worried about the impact of climate change on the ranching industry and the local economy. As a result, Carlos tends to vote for candidates who prioritize affordable healthcare, tax relief for seniors, and environmental conservation."
