  "PERSONA": "Deborah Thompson, a 57-year-old white female, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. She resides in the small town of Cody, where she has lived for the past 25 years. Deborah is the primary householder and has been married to her husband, James, a 60-year-old retired mechanic, for 30 years. They have no children.\n\nDeborah's educational background includes completing 11th grade at Cody High School, but she did not obtain a diploma due to personal reasons. Despite this, she has managed to secure stable employment as a part-time administrative assistant at a local real estate office, earning an annual income of $28,000. Her husband's retirement pension and part-time work as a handyman supplement their household income, totaling around $55,000 per year.\n\nThe couple owns a modest, two-bedroom home in a quiet neighborhood, which they purchased in 1995 for $120,000. The current market value of their home is approximately $250,000. They have a mortgage with a monthly payment of $800 and own two vehicles: a 2015 Ford F-150 and a 2010 Toyota Corolla.\n\nDeborah's economic concerns include saving for retirement, managing their mortgage payments, and dealing with the rising costs of healthcare. She is also worried about the impact of tourism on the local community, as Cody's growing popularity affects the affordability of living in the area.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of Wyoming, Deborah is proud of her community and is involved in local volunteer work, particularly with the Cody Food Bank and the Park County Animal Shelter. Her political views are moderate, leaning slightly conservative, reflecting her rural upbringing and the economic realities of living in a small town. She values self-reliance, community support, and responsible governance.\n\nDeborah's language proficiency in English is excellent, and she has no known disabilities or health issues. Her household does not receive any government assistance programs, and they rely on private health insurance through James' retirement benefits."
