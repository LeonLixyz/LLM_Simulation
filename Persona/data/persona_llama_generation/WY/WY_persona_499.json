  "PERSONA": "Meet John, a 68-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He resides with his 92-year-old mother in a single-family home that has been in the family for over 40 years, located in a quiet suburban neighborhood near the Cheyenne Country Club. John's father passed away 10 years ago, and since then, he has taken on the responsibility of caring for his mother, managing the household, and maintaining their home. This living arrangement is a result of his mother's wish to age in place, and John's commitment to supporting her.\n\nJohn never married and has no children of his own. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he earned in 1978. After college, John worked as a financial analyst for a local bank in Cheyenne for 30 years before retiring at the age of 62. His annual retirement income is approximately $45,000, which includes his pension and social security benefits.\n\nJohn's economic concerns are centered around ensuring his mother's well-being and managing their household expenses. He is particularly worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of Medicaid cuts on his ability to provide for his mother's needs. He also keeps a close eye on property taxes, as their home is their most valuable asset.\n\nDespite his concerns, John is proud of his financial independence and the fact that he has been able to care for his mother without relying on external support. He is active in his community, volunteering at a local senior center and participating in neighborhood initiatives to support older adults.\n\nJohn's political views are moderate, leaning slightly conservative on economic issues. He supports policies that promote small businesses and local economic growth, as well as initiatives that provide tax relief for seniors and caregivers. However, he is also open to progressive ideas that address the needs of vulnerable populations, such as affordable healthcare and social services for the elderly.\n\nAssumptions made based on the metadata include:\n\n* John's ethnicity is assumed to be non-Hispanic, given the absence of any indication of Hispanic origin.\n* The household type is assumed to be a single-family home, based on the fact that John lives with his mother and manages the household.\n* John's language proficiency is assumed to be fluent, given that he speaks English well and has lived in the United States his entire life."
