  "PERSONA": "Meet Evelyn Thompson, a 68-year-old White female living in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming. She resides with her 90-year-old mother in a modest, single-family home that has been in the family for over 40 years. The house, valued at around $280,000, is fully paid off, having been purchased by Evelyn's parents in the 1970s. Evelyn's father passed away in 2010, leaving the property and a substantial life insurance policy, which Evelyn used to cover her mother's living expenses and her own.\n\nEvelyn has never married and does not have any children of her own. She graduated from Cody High School in 1972 and, after a brief stint at a local community college, decided not to pursue higher education. Instead, she worked as an administrative assistant at the local school district for over three decades, retiring in 2015 with a pension that, combined with her mother's social security benefits and the life insurance payout, provides them with a comfortable annual income of around $120,000.\n\nEvelyn is a non-veteran and has always been a US citizen, born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, but raised in Cody. She speaks only English and is fluent in the language. Her primary concerns are healthcare and ensuring her mother receives the best possible care in their golden years. Evelyn's public health insurance coverage, primarily through Medicare and a supplemental plan, alleviates some of her financial worries but leaves her attentive to policy changes that might affect their coverage.\n\nEvelyn's economic situation is relatively stable, with no mortgage payments and a steady income stream. However, she is keenly aware of the rising costs of living, especially healthcare and utilities, which consume a significant portion of their income. She supports policies that aim to reduce healthcare costs and promote senior living affordability, as these directly impact her and her mother's quality of life.\n\nEvelyn is not currently in the labor force, dedicating her time to caregiving and volunteering at local community centers. Her specific economic priorities include maintaining or reducing the costs of healthcare, preserving social security benefits, and ensuring affordable living options for seniors. Despite not being directly affected by employment policies due to her retirement status, Evelyn is supportive of initiatives that promote local job creation and economic growth, hoping these will benefit the younger generations in her community."
