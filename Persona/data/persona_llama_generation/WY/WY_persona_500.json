  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson, a 78-year-old white male, lives with his parents in a rural household in the outskirts of Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Margaret, whom he married 10 years ago in a small ceremony at their local church. Given his advanced age and health considerations, Harold has moved in with his elderly parents to assist with their care and to be cared for in return, as he has mobility issues stemming from a hip replacement surgery a few years ago.\n\nHarold is a high school graduate of Cheyenne's Central High School, class of 1963. After graduating, he worked as a mechanic at a local garage for over 20 years before taking early retirement due to health reasons. His wife, Margaret, works part-time as a librarian at the local library, bringing in a modest income that supplements Harold's retirement benefits.\n\nTheir household income is approximately $45,000 per year, with Harold's retirement and social security benefits making up the bulk of their earnings. Harold and Margaret own their parents' family home, which has been in the family for generations. The property, while not heavily mortgaged, comes with significant upkeep costs, given its age and size.\n\nHarold's primary economic concerns include maintaining affordable healthcare, particularly as his mobility issues require regular medical attention and physical therapy. He is also worried about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, especially the increasing property taxes on their family home. Harold and Margaret have two adult children from his previous marriage, both of whom live out of state and contribute financially to their parents' household when possible.\n\nDespite his physical limitations, Harold remains active in local politics, particularly issues affecting seniors and veterans, although he himself is a non-veteran. He is a staunch supporter of local businesses and advocates for policies that promote rural development and job creation in Wyoming. Harold's political views are influenced by his conservative upbringing and his experience living in a rural community, where self-reliance and community support are deeply ingrained values."
