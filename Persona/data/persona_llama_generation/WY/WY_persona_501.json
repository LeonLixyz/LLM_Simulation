  "PERSONA": "Meet 79-year-old Alberta \"Bert\" Thompson, a Black or African American woman with a mixed racial background, residing in a quiet neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She has been married to her 81-year-old husband, James, for 55 years, and they have no children together. As the primary householder, Alberta manages the household's daily operations and financial decisions. \n\nAlberta was born in Wyoming and has lived there all her life, with deep roots in the community. She grew up in a small town and developed strong ties to the local culture. After completing high school, Alberta attended a local community college for two years, studying business administration but did not obtain a degree. She later worked as a secretary at a law firm in downtown Cheyenne for over 20 years before retiring at 62.\n\nThe Thompsons own a cozy, single-story home in a predominantly middle-class neighborhood, which they purchased in 1985 for $120,000. The house, now valued at around $280,000, is fully paid off, and they have no outstanding mortgage. Their annual property taxes are approximately $2,500, and they pay around $1,200 for homeowners insurance.\n\nAlberta's household income is primarily composed of her husband's pension from the Wyoming state government, where he worked as a civil engineer, and her own social security benefits. Their combined annual income is approximately $55,000. They also have around $200,000 in savings, mostly invested in low-risk bonds and CDs.\n\nAs a retiree, Alberta is concerned about the rising cost of healthcare, especially since her husband has been dealing with chronic health issues. She is also worried about the impact of inflation on their fixed income and the potential for reduced social security benefits in the future. Despite these concerns, Alberta remains optimistic about her community and is actively involved in local volunteer work, particularly with organizations supporting education and healthcare initiatives for low-income families.\n\nAlberta's educational background and work experience have instilled in her a strong appreciation for fiscal responsibility and community engagement. Her concerns about healthcare and economic security are typical of many retirees in her situation, and her involvement in local volunteer work reflects her commitment to giving back to the community that she loves."
