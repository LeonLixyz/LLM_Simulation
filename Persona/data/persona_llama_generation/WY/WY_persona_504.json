  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Jack Harris, a lifelong resident of the United States, born in Idaho but having lived in Wyoming for the past 30 years. Jack is a white male with some Native American ancestry from his mother's side, which he proudly acknowledges but does not actively practice or affiliate with any specific tribe. He lives in a small, two-bedroom house in the outskirts of Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital city, with his long-term partner, Alex, whom he has been with for 20 years but never formally married due to personal preference. \n\nJack's educational background includes completing two years at the University of Wyoming, studying environmental science, but he didn't finish his degree due to financial constraints and the need to support his family. This educational experience has, however, significantly influenced his career path and environmental views. Jack has worked for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality for over 25 years, first as a field technician and later as a senior environmental specialist, earning a modest income of $65,000 annually. His job involves regular travel across the state, assessing and managing environmental projects, which he finds fulfilling.\n\nDespite being the primary householder, Jack and Alex share household responsibilities, with Alex working part-time as a librarian at the local library. Their combined income allows them to live comfortably, with some savings for retirement. They own their home, which they purchased 15 years ago for $180,000, and have managed to pay off a significant portion of the mortgage. Jack is proud of their financial stability, which he attributes to careful budgeting and a conservative spending approach.\n\nJack's primary economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Wyoming, especially healthcare costs, as he and Alex are getting older. He is also worried about the environmental impacts of new development projects in the state and advocates for sustainable practices. Politically, Jack leans towards moderate conservatism, supporting policies that promote environmental protection, local economic growth, and fiscal responsibility. He is an active voter and participates in local community meetings to voice his opinions on issues affecting his community.\n\nIn his free time, Jack enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and fishing, and he is a member of the local Audubon Society, reflecting his passion for environmental conservation. Despite his busy schedule, Jack prioritizes family time and regularly visits his nieces and nephews in Idaho."
