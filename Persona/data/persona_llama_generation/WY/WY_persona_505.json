  "PERSONA": "Meet 19-year-old Ethan Thompson, a high school graduate and primary householder of a married-couple household with kids in a small town in Wyoming. Ethan is a white male, born and raised in the United States, specifically in the state where he currently resides. He speaks English fluently and is a US citizen by birth. \n\nEthan recently married his 19-year-old wife, Emily, and they have a 1-year-old son, Jackson. They live in a modest, two-bedroom rented house in a suburban neighborhood in Casper, Wyoming, with a monthly rent of $800. Ethan's marital status is now married, except separated, as he and Emily are currently living together but are going through a temporary separation due to personal reasons.\n\nEthan works as a full-time farmhand on a local ranch, earning a yearly income of $28,000. He completed his high school diploma from a public school in Casper and did not pursue higher education due to family responsibilities. Ethan's primary concerns are providing for his family and finding better job opportunities to improve their living situation. He is not a veteran and does not have any known disabilities.\n\nEthan's family is his top priority, and he is eager to find ways to create a more stable and secure future for them. Given his situation, Ethan is likely to be concerned about issues like affordable housing, job security, and access to quality education and healthcare. His views on economic and political policies are likely shaped by his personal experiences as a young father and husband trying to make ends meet in a small town with limited job opportunities."
