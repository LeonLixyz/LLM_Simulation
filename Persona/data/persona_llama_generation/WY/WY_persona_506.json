  "PERSONA": "John Michael Davis, a 57-year-old white male, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. John is a US citizen and speaks English fluently, having never spoken another language at home. He is a high school graduate, having completed his education at Natrona County High School in Casper, Wyoming.\n\nJohn currently resides in a homeless shelter in Casper, Wyoming, after facing financial difficulties that led to the loss of his home. Despite his current situation, John is married, but he and his wife, Deborah, are separated due to the strain of his economic struggles. They have two adult children, Emily and Michael, both of whom live out of state and are financially independent.\n\nJohn has never served in the military and has always worked in the private sector. Before becoming homeless, he worked as a truck driver for a local transportation company, earning around $45,000 per year. However, the company downsized, and John found himself without a job. Despite his best efforts, he has been unable to find stable employment in the area, leading to his current situation.\n\nJohn's economic concerns are centered around finding stable employment and getting back on his feet. He is worried about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly in Casper, where the oil industry boom has driven up housing costs. John is also concerned about the lack of affordable healthcare options in the state, as he suffers from chronic back pain due to a work-related injury.\n\nJohn's living situation has forced him to rely on local non-profit organizations for food and clothing. He is eager to get back to a stable life and is seeking assistance from local job training programs to improve his chances of finding employment. John's experience has made him more sympathetic to policies that address homelessness, job training, and affordable healthcare."
