  "PERSONA": "Meet Emily Wilson, a 22-year-old white female living in a small town in Wyoming. She is the primary householder in a single-parent household with two young children, ages 3 and 5. Although Emily is currently married, she and her husband are separated, and she is the sole breadwinner for her family. Emily was born in Oregon but has lived in Wyoming for the past five years. She is a US citizen, fluent in English, and has a bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Education from the University of Wyoming. \n\nEmily works as a preschool teacher at a local daycare center, earning an annual salary of $42,000. She is proud of her career, which allows her to contribute to her community and provide for her children. However, her income is barely enough to cover the expenses of raising two young children on her own. As a result, Emily has to be frugal and prioritize her spending carefully. She rents a modest two-bedroom apartment in a family-friendly neighborhood for $900 per month.\n\nEmily's educational background has been instrumental in securing her job, but it has also left her with a significant amount of student loan debt. She owes $25,000 in student loans and is currently on an income-driven repayment plan. This debt, combined with the financial strain of raising two young children, is a significant source of stress for Emily. She worries about providing a stable future for her children and hopes to one day own a home where they can grow up.\n\nDespite the challenges, Emily is determined to create a better life for herself and her children. She is eager to continue her education and pursue a master's degree in education, which she hopes will lead to better job opportunities and higher pay. Emily's economic concerns are centered around affordable childcare, education, and healthcare. She believes that these services are essential for families like hers and hopes that policymakers will prioritize them in the future."
