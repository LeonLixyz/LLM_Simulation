  "PERSONA": "Meet Emily Wilson, a 68-year-old White female living in the picturesque town of Jackson, Wyoming. She resides with her husband, John, in a spacious, two-story house they own in the town's outskirts, which they purchased for $420,000 in 2005. Emily and John have been married for 43 years, and their children have long since moved out, but they have not yet downsized. Emily's husband is a semi-retired accountant who works part-time, and they have a combined annual income of $125,000.\n\nEmily is a retired high school principal with 30 years of experience in education, training, and library occupations. She earned a Master's degree in Educational Leadership from the University of Wyoming in 1985. Her career trajectory was marked by steady promotions and a deep commitment to her students and community. She is now employed part-time as an educational consultant, working with local schools to develop curriculum and provide teacher training.\n\nAs a US-born citizen, Emily was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and has lived in the state her entire life. She speaks English fluently and has private health insurance through her husband's former employer. Emily's educational background and career have instilled in her a strong appreciation for the importance of education and community development.\n\nEmily's family is her top priority. Her two adult children, both in their 30s, live in nearby towns with their families. She has three grandchildren, who often visit her and John in Jackson. Emily's family responsibilities include helping with childcare and providing emotional support to her children and grandchildren.\n\nEmily's economic concerns revolve around ensuring a stable retirement, managing healthcare costs, and supporting her family's financial well-being. She is also concerned about the impact of Wyoming's economy on local schools and the availability of quality education for future generations. Her experience in education has given her a unique perspective on the state's economic challenges and the importance of investing in human capital.\n\nGiven her background and experiences, Emily is likely to prioritize policies that support education, affordable healthcare, and economic development in Wyoming. She values community engagement and is likely to participate in local politics, advocating for issues that affect her family, friends, and the town she loves."
