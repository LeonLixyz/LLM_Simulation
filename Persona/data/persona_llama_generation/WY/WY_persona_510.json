  "PERSONA": "Margaret 'Maggie' Thompson, a 68-year-old, White, non-Hispanic woman living in a rural area of Wyoming with her 85-year-old mother, for whom she serves as a primary caregiver. Maggie has never been married and does not have any children of her own.\n\nAssumption: Given the lack of information on household type and ethnicity, I have assumed that Maggie is of non-Hispanic origin, which is often the case but not explicitly stated for individuals identifying as White in the US Census data. The household type is assumed to be a single-family household given her living situation with her mother.\n\nEconomic Situation: Maggie works part-time as a librarian assistant at the local library, earning approximately $18,000 per year. Her income is supplemented by her mother's retirement benefits and her own modest savings, which she accumulated over years of working in various low-skilled jobs. They rent a small, two-bedroom house on the outskirts of a small town in Wyoming for $600 per month, a relatively affordable option in the area.\n\nEducational Background: Maggie's educational background is limited to less than 9th grade. She dropped out of high school at 16 to take care of her ailing father and never pursued further education due to family responsibilities and financial constraints. This limited educational attainment has significantly impacted her career trajectory and earning potential.\n\nFamily Structure and Responsibilities: Maggie's primary responsibility is caring for her mother, who suffers from dementia and requires constant supervision. This role has become more demanding over the years, forcing Maggie to reduce her work hours and rely on local community support services for assistance.\n\nGeographic Location: Living in a rural area of Wyoming presents unique economic challenges, including limited job opportunities and access to healthcare services. However, the lower cost of living and strong sense of community are benefits that Maggie appreciates.\n\nEconomic Concerns/Priorities: Maggie's main economic concerns revolve around ensuring her mother receives the best possible care without depleting their limited financial resources. She is also worried about her own financial security post-retirement, given her modest income and lack of substantial retirement savings. Maggie's priorities include affordable healthcare, social security benefits, and programs supporting caregivers and the elderly, reflecting her personal circumstances and responsibilities."
