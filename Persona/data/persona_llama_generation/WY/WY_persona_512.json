  "PERSONA": "John Michael Jenkins, a 48-year-old white male, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. He is a primary householder and has been married to his wife, Sarah, for over 15 years. They do not have any children. John is a veteran, having served in the US Army for 8 years as a logistics specialist, reaching the rank of Sergeant before being honorably discharged.\n\nJohn currently resides in a two-story, three-bedroom house in the suburbs of Casper, Wyoming, which he and his wife own. Their mortgage is $1,200 per month, and they have been diligent in making payments, having already paid off 40% of the original loan. The house, valued at $320,000, serves as a significant portion of their net worth.\n\nJohn's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied business administration but did not complete his degree due to his decision to enlist in the military. After his service, he leveraged his experience to secure a job at a logistics firm in Casper, where he works as a transportation coordinator. He earns $62,000 per year, and his wife, Sarah, works part-time as a librarian at a local elementary school, earning $25,000 annually. Their combined income places them in a comfortable middle-class position, with a household income of $87,000.\n\nTheir financial priorities include paying off their mortgage, saving for retirement, and maintaining their lifestyle. They have been concerned about the economic implications of fluctuations in the energy sector, which significantly impacts Wyoming's economy, and have diversified their investments to mitigate risks. They also prioritize healthcare, given the rising costs and the fact that Sarah has a chronic condition requiring regular medication.\n\nJohn is fluent in English and has no known proficiency in any other language. He values his veteran status and the experiences it has provided him, often participating in local veteran support groups and advocating for policies that support veterans' welfare and employment opportunities. John and Sarah are proud of their community involvement, regularly volunteering at local events and supporting environmental conservation efforts in Wyoming.\n\nTheir lack of children means they have more disposable income, which they use to travel within the United States, often visiting national parks and exploring historical sites. This aspect of their lifestyle reflects their appreciation for American history and the natural beauty of the country.\n\nJohn's political views are moderate, leaning conservative on economic issues due to his belief in personal responsibility and limited government intervention in business. However, his experiences as a veteran and the importance of healthcare for his wife have made him more liberal on social issues, particularly regarding veterans' affairs and healthcare reform."
