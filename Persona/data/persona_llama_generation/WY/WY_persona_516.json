  "PERSONA": "John Michael Harris, a 57-year-old White male, is the primary householder of a single-person household in a modest, rented apartment in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Oklahoma, John moved to Wyoming 15 years ago for work and has since made the state his home. He is a US citizen, fluent in English, and holds a high school diploma from a public school in Oklahoma.\n\nJohn works as a maintenance supervisor at a local manufacturing plant, earning an annual income of $62,000. His job requires strong technical skills, which he developed through on-the-job training and vocational courses after high school. He is proud of his work ethic and takes pride in keeping the plant running smoothly.\n\nDivorced for 10 years, John's marriage ended due to irreconcilable differences, and he has no children. His social life revolves around his work colleagues, hunting trips with friends, and volunteering at a local animal shelter. John values his independence and freedom, often spending his free time outdoors, exploring Wyoming's wilderness areas.\n\nJohn's economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly the increasing rent prices, which have forced him to reconsider his budget and prioritize his expenses. He is also worried about the future of his job due to the decline of manufacturing in the US. Despite these concerns, John is optimistic about his life and feels grateful for the opportunities he has had. He is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to economic development, education, and environmental conservation.\n\nJohn's educational background has influenced his career trajectory, as he had to work multiple jobs to make ends meet before landing a stable position at the manufacturing plant. He believes in the importance of vocational training and apprenticeships, which he thinks would benefit young people in Wyoming.\n\nAs a homeowner in the past, John had to sell his house during his divorce. He currently rents a two-bedroom apartment in a middle-class neighborhood, paying $1,200 per month. He hopes to own a home again in the future but is cautious due to the economic uncertainty.\n\nJohn's experience as a divorced man without kids has taught him to be self-reliant and adaptable. He values his freedom and independence, which he believes are essential for his well-being. Despite the challenges he has faced, John remains hopeful about his future and is committed to making the most of the opportunities available to him in Wyoming."
