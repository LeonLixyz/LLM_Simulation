  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 62-year-old white female, living in the state of Wyoming. Born and raised in Wyoming, Karen is a US citizen and speaks English as her primary language, with no other languages spoken at home. She resides in the town of Lander, a small, rural community in central Wyoming, with her spouse, Jack, in a two-bedroom house they rent for $800 per month. \n\nKaren's educational background includes two years of community college, where she studied business administration but did not graduate due to family obligations. She has been divorced once, from her first marriage, and has been married to Jack, a 65-year-old retired mechanic, for the past 15 years. Jack is the primary breadwinner, earning a pension of $2,500 per month, while Karen works part-time as a receptionist at a local veterinary clinic, earning $1,200 per month.\n\nKaren's household income totals $3,700 per month. They do not have any children living with them, but they do have two adult children from Karen's previous marriage who live out of state. Their eldest child, a 35-year-old son, is a software engineer in California, and their 30-year-old daughter is a nurse in Colorado. Karen and Jack have three grandchildren whom they visit regularly.\n\nKaren's economic concerns include affording healthcare, as Jack's pension does not cover all of their medical expenses, and saving for retirement. They own a 2007 Toyota Corolla, which they use for local errands and trips to visit their children. They also have a small garden where they grow some of their own vegetables to supplement their grocery budget.\n\nKaren is concerned about the local economy, particularly the decline of the coal mining industry, which has affected many of her friends and neighbors. She is also worried about access to affordable healthcare in rural areas and the lack of job opportunities for young people in Wyoming."
