  "PERSONA": "John Michael Harris, a 49-year-old white male, lives in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital. As the primary householder, he resides in a modest, rented two-bedroom apartment in a mixed-use neighborhood, reflecting the city's blend of old and new developments. His marital status is married, but currently separated, which has led to a single-person household. John does not have any children.\n\nBorn in Oregon, John moved to Wyoming for its wide-open spaces and outdoor recreational opportunities. He holds an Associate's degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology from Laramie County Community College, which he earned after serving an apprenticeship with a local machinery repair firm. This educational background and hands-on experience have been instrumental in his career as a maintenance supervisor at a large manufacturing plant in Cheyenne.\n\nJohn's annual income is approximately $62,000, which is slightly above the median household income in Cheyenne. His job requires strong problem-solving skills and the ability to manage a team of technicians. He takes pride in his work, ensuring the plant runs efficiently and safely.\n\nAs a non-veteran, John's perspectives on national security and foreign policy might be influenced more by his personal values and community involvement rather than direct military experience. His primary concerns include affordable healthcare, education, and the economy, which he believes are essential for the well-being of his community and the country at large.\n\nJohn is fluent in English and has never spoken any other language at home, reflecting his upbringing in a predominantly English-speaking environment. His birth in a different state and current residence in Wyoming might influence his views on state and federal policies, particularly those related to regional development and environmental conservation.\n\nGiven his marital status and lack of dependents, John's economic priorities may focus on personal financial security, possibly including saving for retirement and managing healthcare costs. His experience living in a rented apartment might also make him attentive to policies affecting housing affordability and renters' rights."
