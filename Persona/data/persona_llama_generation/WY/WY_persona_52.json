  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 27-year-old white male, is a firefighter residing in Casper, Wyoming. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Sarah, who is currently pursuing her bachelor's degree in nursing at Casper College. Ethan and Sarah live in a modest, two-bedroom apartment in a middle-class neighborhood near downtown Casper, for which they pay $850 per month in rent.\n\nEthan's educational background includes completing two years of coursework at Casper College, focusing on fire science and emergency medical services before joining the Casper Fire Department. His decision to forgo completing his degree was largely influenced by the opportunity to start working and earning a steady income to support himself and his wife. As a firefighter, Ethan earns $12,500 annually, which falls within the lower end of the income spectrum for his profession due to his limited years of service.\n\nEthan's career as a firefighter is demanding, with irregular schedules that often require him to work long hours, including night shifts and weekends. Despite the challenges, Ethan finds his job highly rewarding and is committed to his role in serving the community. However, the physical demands of his job and the lack of health insurance coverage are significant concerns for him and his wife, who worries about the financial implications of unexpected medical expenses.\n\nGiven his income and the cost of living in Casper, Ethan and Sarah have to budget carefully. They allocate a significant portion of their income towards rent and utilities, leaving them with limited disposable income for savings, entertainment, or unexpected expenses. Ethan's economic concerns revolve around job security, the potential for career advancement within the fire department, and the hope of eventually earning a higher salary that would allow them to afford a home and start a family.\n\nEthan and Sarah are avid supporters of local community initiatives and often participate in volunteer work in their free time. They value the close-knit community in Casper and appreciate the small-town feel that allows them to know their neighbors and feel connected to the place they call home. Ethan's political views are shaped by his experience as a public servant and his desire to see improvements in local infrastructure, better support for first responders, and affordable healthcare options for all members of the community."
