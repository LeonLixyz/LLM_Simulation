  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 29-year-old white male who is the primary householder of his household. He is married, but due to his work schedule and temporary relocation for his job, he and his wife are currently living apart. Ryan is a veteran, having served four years in the US Army before being honorably discharged. He was born in Wyoming, where he currently resides, specifically in the town of Casper, the second-largest city in the state. \n\nRyan's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied business administration but did not complete his degree due to financial constraints. Despite this, he has managed to secure a stable job as a field technician in the oil and gas industry, a sector that is prominent in Wyoming. His job requires frequent travel, contributing to his current separation from his wife. Ryan's annual income is $65,000, which is slightly above the median household income in Wyoming.\n\nRyan and his wife, whom he met in high school, are planning to start a family in the near future, but their current situation has delayed these plans. They own a modest home in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, with a mortgage that they are diligently working to pay off. Ryan's experience as a veteran and his current job have instilled in him a strong sense of independence and self-reliance. However, he also values family and community, often volunteering in local veterans' organizations and participating in community events when his schedule allows.\n\nRyan's economic concerns are centered around job security, given the fluctuations in the oil and gas industry, and the cost of living, particularly housing costs, which seem to be increasing in Casper. He is also keenly interested in policies that support veterans' welfare and education, as he believes these are crucial for successful reintegration into civilian life. Despite his current marital status being \"married, except separated,\" Ryan and his wife maintain a strong relationship and are looking forward to reuniting and starting a family in the not-too-distant future."
