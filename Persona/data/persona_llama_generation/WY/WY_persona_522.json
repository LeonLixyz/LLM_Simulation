  "PERSONA": "Lynn Thompson, a 68-year-old white female, lives in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Despite being listed as \"Never married,\" Lynn's household relationship is that of a primary householder in a married-couple household with kids, suggesting a long-term, committed partnership or an error in the marital status data. For the purposes of this persona, it will be assumed that Lynn is in a long-term, unmarried partnership.\n\nLynn was born in Oregon but has lived in Wyoming for over 20 years. She has some college education, having attended the University of Wyoming for two years, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. Lynn is fluent in English and has no proficiency in any other language.\n\nLynn's partner, John, works as a civil engineer for the state of Wyoming, earning a combined household income of approximately $83,000 per year. Lynn works part-time as a bookkeeper for a local dental clinic, contributing about $25,000 to their annual income. They have two children, both in their late teens, who attend Cheyenne's public high school.\n\nThe family owns a modest, three-bedroom home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they purchased in 2005 for $220,000. They have a mortgage with a monthly payment of $1,200 and an additional $500 in monthly property taxes.\n\nLynn and her family are concerned about rising healthcare costs, especially with her partner's aging parents requiring more medical attention. Their economic priorities include saving for their children's college education and ensuring they have a secure retirement. Lynn is also involved in local community activities, volunteering at the local animal shelter and participating in town hall meetings, which has sparked her interest in local politics, particularly issues related to education and healthcare policy."
