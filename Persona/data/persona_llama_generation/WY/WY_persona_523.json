  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 49-year-old white male, born in the state of Montana but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Ryan lives in a married-couple household with kids, although his marital status is divorced, indicating a blended or co-parenting arrangement. He shares a two-story house in a suburban neighborhood with his 10-year-old son, Ethan, and his 7-year-old daughter, Emily, who live with him full-time. Their mother, Ryan's ex-wife, lives in a nearby town and is involved in the children's lives.\n\nRyan works as a diesel mechanic at a local trucking company, earning an annual income of $62,000. He has an associate's degree in automotive technology from a community college in Montana, which he obtained after completing a vocational training program right out of high school. This education has served him well in his career, allowing him to secure stable employment in the industry.\n\nRyan is a US citizen by birth and speaks English as his primary language. Although his parents were high school sweethearts who never attended college, Ryan's decision to pursue post-secondary education was motivated by a desire to provide a better life for himself and his future family.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Ryan's community involvement is centered around his children's activities, such as coaching Ethan's Little League team and volunteering at Emily's elementary school. His economic concerns are focused on saving for his children's education, maintaining a stable income, and navigating the challenges of co-parenting while managing the household expenses on his own.\n\nRyan's household expenses include a $1,200 monthly mortgage payment on their $220,000 home, which they purchased five years ago. He also pays $800 per month in child support to his ex-wife. Despite these expenses, Ryan prioritizes saving for his children's future, allocating 10% of his income to a 529 college savings plan.\n\nIn his free time, Ryan enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and fishing in the nearby mountains. He is concerned about the economic implications of Wyoming's declining coal industry and the potential impact on the local job market. As a result, Ryan is interested in policies that support workforce development and diversification of the state's economy."
