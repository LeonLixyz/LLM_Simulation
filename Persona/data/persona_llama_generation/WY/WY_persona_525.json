  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old white female, is the primary householder of her household. She is married but lives separately from her spouse, a common arrangement due to her spouse's work commitments in the mining industry. Born in Wyoming, Alex is a lifelong resident of the state and has lived in various parts of it. She currently resides in a rented, two-bedroom apartment in the downtown area of Casper, the second-largest city in Wyoming. \n\nAlex holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Casper College, which she earned after completing her high school education in her hometown of Riverton, Wyoming. Her educational background has been instrumental in securing her current job as an office manager at a small, local insurance firm in Casper. Her annual income is $52,000, which is above the median household income in Casper but still reflects the relatively lower cost of living in Wyoming.\n\nAs a non-veteran and a fluent English speaker born in the US, Alex's experiences and worldview are deeply rooted in American culture and the values of the Mountain West. She is proud of her Wyoming upbringing and feels a strong connection to the outdoors and the community-oriented lifestyle that is prevalent in the state.\n\nDespite her stable income and fulfilling job, Alex's primary economic concern is saving for a down payment on a house. As a renter, she feels that she is missing out on the financial benefits of homeownership, which is a common aspiration in her community. Her long-term goal is to purchase a home in the suburbs of Casper, where she can put down roots and enjoy the benefits of homeownership.\n\nAlex's marital situation and lack of children mean that her household expenses are relatively low, but she still prioritizes saving for the future and maintaining a comfortable lifestyle. Her economic priorities include affordable housing, access to quality healthcare, and policies that support small businesses and local economic development. As a resident of Wyoming, she is also keenly interested in policies related to natural resource management and environmental conservation, given the state's reliance on these industries."
