  "PERSONA": "Meet John Wilson, a 57-year-old white male residing in a small suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Karen, whom he met at a local diner where he worked part-time as a teenager. John and Karen, who is the household's primary breadwinner as a nurse, have been married for 35 years. They live in a modest, single-family home valued at approximately $250,000, which they purchased in 2002 for $120,000. Their two children, Emily and Ryan, have moved out of the house to pursue higher education and careers in other states.\n\nJohn graduated from Cheyenne's East High School in 1986. Despite his high school diploma being his highest level of education, he has managed to secure stable employment in the construction sector. He works as a project coordinator for a local firm specializing in residential and commercial building projects, earning an annual income of $62,000. This job provides him with health insurance and a modest 401(k) plan, contributing to his economic stability.\n\nAs a non-veteran and having never served in the military, John's views on military spending and veterans' benefits are shaped by his close relationships with friends and family members who have served. His economic concerns are primarily centered around job security, access to affordable healthcare, and the rising cost of living, particularly housing costs, which he believes are becoming unaffordable for young families in Wyoming.\n\nJohn is fluent in English and has never spoken any other language at home. Born and raised in Wyoming, his state pride and local loyalty influence his political views, particularly regarding environmental policies and the balance between natural resource extraction and conservation. He values the wide open spaces and outdoor lifestyle Wyoming offers and is concerned about the impact of large-scale development on these aspects.\n\nIn his free time, John enjoys hunting and fishing, activities that allow him to connect with nature and spend time with friends and family. His community involvement is mostly through local sports leagues and occasional volunteer work at the Cheyenne Animal Shelter, where Karen also volunteers. John's economic and political views are shaped by his family responsibilities, job security concerns, and a deep connection to his community and state."
