  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old White female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is in a long-term, unmarried partnership with her 40-year-old partner, Ryan, a local electrician, and they reside together in a modest, two-bedroom rental apartment in a mixed-income neighborhood near downtown Casper.\n\nAssuming Alex's partner is the household's primary breadwinner, Alex works part-time as a dental assistant at a small, private practice, earning around $28,000 per year. She has been with the practice for five years and enjoys the flexible schedule that allows her to pursue her passion for photography on the side. Alex's education background includes two years of study at Casper College, where she pursued an associate's degree in dental hygiene but did not complete it due to financial constraints.\n\nBorn in Billings, Montana, Alex moved to Wyoming with her family at a young age and has lived in Casper for over a decade. She is a US citizen and speaks English fluently, with no other languages spoken at home. As a non-veteran, Alex does not have any direct military connections, but her partner's brother is a veteran, and they occasionally participate in local veteran support events.\n\nAlex and Ryan do not have any children, but they are considering starting a family in the next few years. They own a 2018 Subaru Outback, which they use for weekend trips to explore Wyoming's national parks and forests. As a couple, they prioritize saving for a down payment on a home, hoping to purchase a starter house in the next three to five years.\n\nEconomically, Alex is concerned about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly the increasing housing costs and the impact of tourism on the local job market. She supports policies that promote affordable housing, education, and workforce development, as she believes these initiatives will benefit her community and improve her chances of advancing in her career."
