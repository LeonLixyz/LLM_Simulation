  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 49-year-old male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He identifies as \"Some Other Race\" and prefers not to specify his ethnicity. Juan is currently married and resides with his parents, due to financial constraints that have been exacerbated by the economic downturn in his industry. His wife, Maria, lives with him, and they have a 10-year-old son, Carlos, who is in the 5th grade. \n\nJuan is a high school graduate and did not pursue higher education due to financial limitations. He has been working as a diesel mechanic at a local trucking company for the past 15 years, earning approximately $52,000 per year. This job has allowed him to develop a strong work ethic and a sense of pride in his ability to provide for his family. However, the recent economic shift has led to a decrease in job security and an increase in financial stress for Juan and his family.\n\nJuan was born in New Mexico but moved to Wyoming with his parents when he was a teenager. He is a US citizen and speaks English fluently, having grown up in a bilingual household. He is not a veteran but has a deep respect for those who serve in the military. \n\nJuan's economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and education for his son. He is worried about the rising costs of living in Wyoming and the potential for his job to be outsourced or automated. He is also concerned about the quality of education in his local school district and the limited access to resources for his son's future. \n\nJuan's living situation, while not ideal, has allowed him to save money on rent and focus on paying off debt. However, he hopes to move into his own home within the next few years, which would be a significant step towards financial stability and independence. \n\nJuan's priorities are his family, his job, and his community. He is a hardworking individual who values honesty, integrity, and self-reliance. He is likely to support policies that promote job creation, affordable education, and access to healthcare, as these issues directly impact his daily life and the well-being of his family."
