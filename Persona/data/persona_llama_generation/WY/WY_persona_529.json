She is the primary householder of her single-family home in a quiet suburban neighborhood of Casper, Wyoming, where she has lived for 15 years. \n\nEconomically, she is a retired administrative assistant, having worked for the local government for 25 years.

She has a total annual income of $53,000 and owns her home, valued at $180,000, with a mortgage of $30,000 remaining.\n\nHer educational background consists of two years of community college, where she studied business administration, but she never completed her degree due to financial constraints. Despite this, she has had a stable career and has been able to save enough for retirement.\n\nAs a single person with no children, her economic concerns are primarily focused on maintaining her independence, affording healthcare, and ensuring the value of her home. She is particularly interested in local policies that support senior citizens, such as affordable healthcare options, property tax relief, and community programs for the elderly.\n\nShe is an English speaker with no known ethnic affiliation and identifies as a US citizen by birth. Her lack of family responsibilities allows her to engage in her community through volunteering at the local library and participating in neighborhood watch programs."
