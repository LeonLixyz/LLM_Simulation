  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 28-year-old White female, born in California but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder in a non-traditional household setup, given her marital status as divorced, yet living with her long-term partner, Ryan, in a married-couple without kids arrangement. They share a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Cheyenne, with a monthly rent of $1,200.\n\nAlex holds a position as an Operations Manager at a local outdoor gear manufacturing company, where she has been employed for the past three years. Her annual income is $87,500, placing her in a relatively stable financial position. She has private health insurance through her employer, covering 80% of her medical expenses.\n\nEducationally, Alex attended the University of Wyoming but did not complete her degree in Business Administration due to financial constraints. Despite this, she has been able to advance in her career through on-the-job training and certifications. Her career trajectory has been influenced by her strong organizational skills and ability to lead teams effectively.\n\nGiven her economic situation, Alex's primary concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, as she and Ryan plan to purchase a home in the next two years. She is also focused on paying off her student loan debt of $20,000, which she hopes to settle within the next five years. Her economic priorities are centered around financial security and stability, which influences her views on policies related to affordable housing, education, and employment opportunities.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. She is an avid supporter of local businesses and environmental conservation efforts, often participating in community events and volunteering for local causes. Her experiences as a divorced woman in a non-traditional household setup and her career ambitions have shaped her perspectives on social and economic policies, particularly those related to women's rights, family dynamics, and workforce development."
