  "PERSONA": "Karl J. M\u00fcller, a 62-year-old white male, resides in a rural town in Wyoming with his long-term partner, whom he considers his spouse despite not being legally married. Karl is a US-born citizen, having been born in the state of Wyoming, and speaks fluent English, although his native language is German, which he learned from his parents who immigrated to the United States before he was born. \n\nKarl holds an Associate's degree in Agricultural Business from a local community college, which has served him well in his role as an agricultural equipment salesman for a small, family-owned business in his hometown. With an annual income of $53,000, Karl is considered middle-class, and he and his partner own a modest home on the outskirts of town, valued at $220,000, with a mortgage that they have been paying off for the past 15 years.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Karl's political views are shaped more by his experiences as a small business employee and rural resident, where he prioritizes issues related to agriculture, land management, and access to healthcare in rural areas. His economic concerns revolve around the impact of global market fluctuations on local agricultural businesses and the struggle to attract and retain young talent in rural areas.\n\nKarl's household is a non-traditional family unit, consisting of himself and his partner of 25 years, who works as a part-time librarian at the local school district. They have no children of their own but are involved in their community through volunteering at the local animal shelter and participating in town hall meetings to advocate for the needs of rural residents.\n\nAssumptions made based on the metadata include:\n- Household Type: Given Karl's marital status as \"Never married\" and his household relationship as \"Spouse of Householder,\" it is assumed that Karl lives in a non-traditional family setup with his long-term partner.\n- Ethnicity: Given Karl's language is listed as \"Other Indo-European languages\" and his ability to speak English well, along with his surname, it is inferred that Karl might have a German ethnic background, although this is not explicitly stated in the metadata."
