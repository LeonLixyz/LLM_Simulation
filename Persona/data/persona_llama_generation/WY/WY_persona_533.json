  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson is a 38-year-old woman who identifies as White and Some Other Race, specifically having a mixed background with a Native American grandmother. She is the primary householder in her household, living with her long-term partner, Jamie, in a small, two-bedroom apartment in Laramie, Wyoming. Despite being in a long-term committed relationship, Alex has never formally married, prioritizing financial stability and independence.\n\nAlex was born in Montana but moved to Wyoming about five years ago for better job opportunities. She did not complete high school, leaving in the 11th grade to work full-time and support her family after her mother's illness. This early entrance into the workforce has influenced her views on education and job training, making her a strong advocate for vocational programs and apprenticeships.\n\nAlex works as a dental assistant at a local clinic, earning approximately $43,000 per year. Her partner, Jamie, works as a freelance graphic designer, contributing to their household income, which totals around $70,000 annually. They rent their apartment for $1,200 per month and have been considering saving for a down payment on a house, but rising housing costs and uncertainty about the future have them hesitant.\n\nGiven her background and current situation, Alex's economic concerns revolve around job security, affordable healthcare, and the rising cost of living in Wyoming. She is particularly interested in policies that support workforce development, affordable housing initiatives, and accessible healthcare options. Politically, she leans towards moderate policies that emphasize practical, local solutions over ideological stances, reflecting her pragmatic approach to life and financial planning."
