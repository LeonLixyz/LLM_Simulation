  "PERSONA": "Meet Alejandro \"Alex\" Guti\u00e9rrez, an 18-year-old high school graduate living in a modest one-bedroom apartment in Casper, Wyoming. Alex is a first-generation Wyoming resident, born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to a family of Mexican descent, which he identifies with culturally, although the ethnicity field was left unmarked in the records. He is the primary householder, meaning he is the main person responsible for the household, which is unusual for someone of his age. This is due to his recent marriage to his 19-year-old wife, who is currently pursuing her GED. They are not separated, but due to their young age and financial constraints, they are not yet living together full-time.\n\nAlex works as a part-time retail sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, earning approximately $18,000 per year. His wife is currently not working due to her focus on education but plans to start part-time work soon. They are renting their apartment for $800 per month, which is relatively affordable in Casper. Alex is fluent in Spanish, which is his first language, and speaks English well, having learned it in school. He graduated from Natrona County High School with a 3.2 GPA and was active in the school's soccer team.\n\nGiven his income and financial responsibilities, Alex's primary economic concerns include affording rent, saving for his wife's education, and planning for their future, possibly including starting a family. He is eager to find better-paying job opportunities or pursue higher education to improve their economic situation. Living in Wyoming, Alex is also interested in policies related to affordable housing, education, and economic development in rural areas."
