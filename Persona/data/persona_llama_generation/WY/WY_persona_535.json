  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 69-year-old white male, born and raised in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming. He is of Spanish descent, and as such, his primary language is Spanish, although he speaks some English. However, he is not proficient in English, speaking it less than very well. This is a reasonable assumption based on his language proficiency level.\n\nJuan is a college-educated individual, holding a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming. This educational background has significantly impacted his career trajectory. He has worked as a manager in the retail sector for most of his life, specifically in a local family-owned store in Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital city. His current annual income is $55,000.\n\nJuan is married to his wife, Maria, and they have been together for over 40 years. They are currently living with their 42-year-old son, Carlos, who has moved back in with them due to financial difficulties. This living arrangement is not uncommon, given the economic challenges faced by many families in the region. Juan's marital status as \"now married, except separated\" suggests that he and his wife have had their share of challenges but are working through them.\n\nAs a resident of Cheyenne, Juan is deeply rooted in the local community. He and his wife own a modest single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood, which they purchased over 30 years ago. The house is valued at around $250,000, with a monthly mortgage payment of $1,200. They also have a small garden in their backyard, where they grow some of their own fruits and vegetables.\n\nGiven his age and health concerns, Juan's economic priorities are focused on ensuring a comfortable retirement and maintaining his family's well-being. He is concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on his social security benefits. These concerns are likely to influence his political views, particularly on issues related to healthcare, social security, and economic stability."
