  "PERSONA": "A 28-year-old white female, living in a rural area of Cheyenne, Wyoming, with her parents. She is of Eastern European descent, specifically Polish, which is reflected in her primary language at home, but she speaks English well. Having lost her spouse at a young age, she is a widow, which significantly influences her economic and social outlook. \n\nShe holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Laramie County Community College, which she completed in 2018. She works as an administrative assistant at a local insurance agency, earning approximately $38,000 per year. This job provides her with a stable income and benefits, which is crucial given her situation.\n\nShe lives with her parents in their single-family home in a suburban neighborhood. The home is valued at around $250,000, and her parents are still paying the mortgage. She contributes to the household expenses by paying rent of about $800 per month, which helps her parents with the mortgage payments.\n\nHer marital status as a widow significantly affects her economic priorities. Her primary economic concern is securing her financial future, particularly in terms of saving for retirement and managing the financial responsibilities that come with potentially raising a family in the future. She values policies that support widows, such as survivor benefits and affordable healthcare.\n\nHer experience living with her parents has also influenced her views on family support and social welfare policies. She believes in the importance of family support systems and government assistance for families in need. However, she is also cautious about government spending and advocates for fiscal responsibility.\n\nGiven her background and situation, she is likely to vote for policies that promote economic stability, support for widows and families, and affordable healthcare."
