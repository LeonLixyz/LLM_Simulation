  "PERSONA": "Alex Thompson, a 27-year-old White male, currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder of a married-couple household without kids but is currently separated from his wife. Alex was born in Oregon, USA, and holds US citizenship. He speaks English fluently and has no known ethnic affiliation.\n\nEducationally, Alex has some college education but does not hold a degree, having attended Laramie County Community College in Wyoming for two years, studying business administration. This background has equipped him with basic business skills, which he utilizes in his current role as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Cheyenne.\n\nAlex's annual income is approximately $43,000, which allows him to afford a modest lifestyle. He rents a two-bedroom apartment in a suburban neighborhood for $900 per month. Despite his separation, Alex maintains a stable economic situation, with manageable expenses and a relatively secure job.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex's economic concerns are influenced by the state's economy, which is heavily reliant on the energy industry. He is concerned about job security, given the fluctuations in the energy sector, and hopes for economic diversification in the state to ensure more stable employment opportunities.\n\nGiven his situation, Alex's political views may lean towards policies that support economic stability, job security, and affordable housing. His experience as a renter and his modest income might make him more inclined to support policies that address income inequality and provide assistance for middle-class families."
