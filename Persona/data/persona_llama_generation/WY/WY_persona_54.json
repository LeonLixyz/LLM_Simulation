  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Rodriguez, a 49-year-old single female living in Jackson, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of her household and has never been married. Born in Wyoming, Alex is a US citizen and speaks English fluently. Her racial background is mixed, with a Hispanic and Native American heritage, which she identifies as \"Some Other Race.\"\n\nAlex's highest level of education is some college, but she did not complete her degree. She attended Casper College in Wyoming, where she studied environmental science but left after two years due to financial constraints. Despite not having a degree, Alex has always been passionate about environmental conservation and volunteers regularly at the local Teton County Parks and Recreation department.\n\nAs the primary householder, Alex owns her home, a modest two-bedroom condo in a suburban neighborhood of Jackson. She purchased the condo in 2010 for $220,000, and it is now valued at around $350,000. Her monthly mortgage payment is approximately $1,800, which she can afford comfortably with her annual income of $85,000. Alex's income comes from a trust fund established by her parents, which she inherited after their passing in 2015.\n\nAlex is not currently in the labor force, having chosen to take time off to focus on her environmental activism and volunteer work. She has been involved in various local initiatives, including the Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance and the Wyoming Outdoor Council. Her lack of employment is a deliberate choice, allowing her to devote more time to her passions and community.\n\nAlex's insurance coverage is through the Wyoming Medicaid program, which she qualifies for due to her income level and lack of employer-sponsored coverage. She values her public coverage and has been an advocate for expanding Medicaid in Wyoming to cover more low-income residents.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Alex is concerned about the state's economic reliance on fossil fuels and the impact of climate change on the local environment. She is also worried about the rising cost of living in Jackson, particularly the increasing housing costs and the strain it puts on low- and middle-income residents. Alex is likely to support policies that promote renewable energy, affordable housing, and environmental conservation, as well as initiatives that address income inequality and access to healthcare."
