  "PERSONA": "Name: Ethan Thompson\n\nAge: 29 years old\n\nSex: Male\n\nRace: White, non-Hispanic (assuming non-Hispanic given null ethnicity)\n\nOccupation: Ethan works as a sales representative at a small, independent outdoor gear store in Casper, Wyoming, a job he secured after completing two years of community college with a focus on business administration. His annual income is approximately $45,000.\n\nEducation: Ethan attended Casper College for two years, studying business administration but did not complete his degree due to financial constraints. Despite this, his education has significantly impacted his career trajectory, providing him with the necessary skills to excel in sales and customer service.\n\nFamily Structure: Ethan is married to his high school sweetheart, Emily, who works as a nurse at a local hospital. They do not have any children, focusing instead on establishing their careers and building a stable financial foundation. They live in a modest, two-bedroom house on the outskirts of Casper, which they purchased three years ago for $220,000 with a mortgage of $1,400 per month.\n\nGeographic Location: Ethan resides in Casper, Wyoming, a city with a relatively low cost of living and a strong sense of community. He enjoys the outdoor recreational opportunities the state offers, often spending his free time hiking, camping, and fishing in the nearby mountains.\n\nEconomic Concerns: Ethan's primary economic concerns are saving for the future, particularly for a potential down payment on a larger house should they decide to start a family, and paying off his student loan debt, which totals $10,000. He is also concerned about the stability of his job in the face of increasing online competition in the retail sector.\n\nPolitical Priorities: Given his situation, Ethan's political priorities tend to focus on economic issues such as job security, access to affordable healthcare (important for his wife's career and their future family plans), and education reform to make college more accessible and affordable. He also supports policies that protect Wyoming's natural resources and promote sustainable tourism, as these are crucial to the local economy and his personal enjoyment of the outdoors."
