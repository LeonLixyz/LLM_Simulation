  "PERSONA": "John \"Jack\" Thompson is a 62-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder of a married-couple household without kids. Jack has been married to his wife, Susan, for 38 years. They met in high school in their hometown of Cheyenne and got married shortly after graduation. Susan works part-time as a librarian at the local library, while Jack is a retired mechanic who owned a small auto repair shop before selling it five years ago. Jack's annual retirement income is approximately $45,000, supplemented by Susan's part-time income of $18,000. \n\nJack is a high school graduate, having attended Cheyenne's Central High School. Although he never pursued higher education, his technical skills as a mechanic allowed him to build a successful business. Jack's lack of college education sometimes makes him feel left behind in the rapidly changing job market, but his experience and reputation in the community have earned him respect and loyalty from his customers.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Jack did not serve in the military, but he comes from a family with a strong military tradition. His father was a World War II veteran, and Jack's younger brother served in the Vietnam War. Jack is proud of his family's service and actively participates in local veterans' events.\n\nJack and Susan own a modest single-family home in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, which they purchased 25 years ago for $120,000. The current value of their home is approximately $280,000. They have no children, but they have a close relationship with their nieces and nephews, who often visit them during school breaks.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Jack is concerned about the economic implications of declining coal production and the shift towards renewable energy sources. He worries about the impact on local jobs and the state's economy. Jack is also concerned about access to affordable healthcare, as he and his wife are approaching an age where they will require more medical care. Jack's economic priorities include preserving Social Security and Medicare benefits, as well as supporting small businesses and local economic development initiatives.\n\nJack's daily life revolves around his community. He volunteers at the local animal shelter, participates in the Cheyenne Lions Club, and enjoys outdoor activities such as fishing and hunting. Jack's strong sense of community and social connections influence his economic and political views, as he tends to prioritize local interests and support policies that benefit small businesses and community development."
