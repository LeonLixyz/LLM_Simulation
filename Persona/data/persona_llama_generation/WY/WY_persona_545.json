  "PERSONA": "John Thompson, a 68-year-old white male, is the primary householder of a single-person household in the town of Jackson, Wyoming. He has never been married and does not have any children. Born in the state of Colorado, John is a US citizen who speaks English fluently. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 1979.\n\nJohn works as a retired Environmental Consultant, having spent most of his career working for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. He retired in 2015 after 30 years of service and currently receives a monthly pension of $3,500. Additionally, he earns $1,200 per month from renting out a small cabin on his property to tourists.\n\nJohn owns his single-family home, valued at $350,000, which he purchased in 1995 for $120,000. His annual property taxes are $2,500, and he has a mortgage payment of $800 per month. He also owns a 2015 Ford F-150 pickup truck, which he purchased new for $30,000.\n\nJohn's annual income is approximately $63,600 ($3,500 pension + $14,400 rental income), placing him in a relatively comfortable financial situation. However, he is concerned about the rising cost of living in Jackson, particularly the increasing property taxes and the growing number of tourists, which he believes are eroding the town's character.\n\nJohn's economic priorities include preserving the natural beauty of Wyoming, supporting local businesses, and ensuring that the town's growth is sustainable and environmentally friendly. He is also concerned about the impact of climate change on the local ecosystem and the need for renewable energy sources. Politically, John leans towards conservative environmental policies and is likely to support candidates who prioritize environmental protection and responsible land use."
