  "PERSONA": "Meet 29-year-old Ethan Thompson, a white male living in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. Ethan was born in Colorado but has lived in Wyoming for most of his life, having moved there with his family at the age of 10. He currently resides with his parents in a modest, single-family home in a rural neighborhood. Ethan is married to his high school sweetheart, Rachel, whom he wed at 25, and they do not have any children yet.\n\nEthan's educational background is a high school equivalency diploma, which he obtained after dropping out of Lander Valley High School in the 11th grade to work and support his family financially. His decision to leave school was influenced by his family's economic situation; his father, a self-employed carpenter, faced a downturn in business, and Ethan felt the need to contribute. Despite this setback, Ethan has always been interested in mechanics and, through vocational training, acquired certification as an automotive technician.\n\nEthan works full-time at a local car repair shop, earning around $38,000 per year. His job is stable, but he faces challenges in advancing his career due to his lack of formal education beyond high school. Ethan's wife, Rachel, works part-time as a waitress, bringing in an additional $18,000 annually. Together, they manage to make ends meet, but they struggle with saving for the future, particularly for buying their own home.\n\nEthan's primary economic concerns revolve around job security, affordable housing, and access to further education or training that could enhance his career prospects. He feels the pinch of Wyoming's economic fluctuations, particularly in the energy sector, which affects the local job market. Ethan is also worried about healthcare costs, as his family has experienced medical emergencies in the past, leading to significant financial burdens.\n\nPolitically, Ethan tends to lean conservative due to his upbringing and the prevailing views in his community. However, his personal experiences have made him more sympathetic to policies that support education, job training, and affordable healthcare. Ethan is particularly interested in initiatives that could boost local economies through infrastructure development and small business support, seeing these as crucial for creating more stable, well-paying jobs in Wyoming.\n\nEthan's living situation with his parents is not by choice but by necessity. He and Rachel hope to save enough to move into their own home soon, a goal that is both a personal milestone and a financial challenge. Despite the economic pressures, Ethan remains optimistic about his future, believing in the importance of hard work and the potential for better opportunities through education and policy changes that support working-class families like his own."
