  "PERSONA": "Meet James Wilson, a 62-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. James is married to his wife, Karen, and they reside together in a single-family home they purchased in 2005 in a suburban neighborhood. As the spouse of the household, James supports his wife, who works part-time as a librarian. James himself works full-time as a maintenance supervisor at a local school district, earning approximately $52,000 per year. He has been in this role for over 15 years and is proud of his ability to provide a stable income for his family.\n\nJames was born in Nebraska but moved to Wyoming 30 years ago for his job. He holds a high school diploma from his hometown in Nebraska and has not pursued further formal education. Despite this, he has managed to secure a well-paying job through his experience and vocational training in maintenance and repair.\n\nJames and Karen have two grown children who are both married and living in other parts of the country. Their eldest son is a teacher in Colorado, and their daughter is a nurse in Oregon. They have three grandchildren, whom they visit regularly. James's family responsibilities are mostly centered around supporting his wife and visiting their children and grandchildren.\n\nJames speaks only English and has no known disabilities. He is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. His economic concerns are primarily centered around saving for retirement and ensuring that he and his wife can maintain their current standard of living. With their children grown and independent, James and Karen are focused on their own needs and are considering downsizing their home in the near future to reduce expenses.\n\nAssumptions made based on the provided metadata include:\n\n* James's household type is assumed to be a married-couple household, given his marital status and household relationship.\n* James's ethnicity is assumed to be non-Hispanic, given the lack of any indication of Hispanic ethnicity in the provided metadata.\n* James's neighborhood type is assumed to be suburban, given the context of his job and location in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nThese assumptions are made to provide a more complete picture of James's life and are based on the information provided in the metadata."
