  "PERSONA": "Agnes Little Deer, a 79-year-old American Indian and Alaska Native woman, lives with her elderly parents in a rural town in Wyoming. Born in Montana, Agnes moved to Wyoming 40 years ago when she married her husband, a veteran who served in the US Army. They settled in the small town of Riverton, where Agnes's husband worked as a mechanic until his retirement. Agnes herself did not complete high school, leaving in the 11th grade to work and support her family, but she speaks English fluently and has never spoken any other language at home.\n\nAgnes and her husband, now 82, have been married for 55 years and have two children, both of whom have moved away to cities for work. Their son is an engineer in Denver, and their daughter is a teacher in Cheyenne. Agnes's parents, aged 96 and 98, moved in with them 10 years ago, requiring Agnes to take on a caregiving role. \n\nAgnes is a veteran of the US Navy, having served for four years as a medical assistant. She received private health insurance through her husband's retirement plan and also qualifies for veteran's benefits, ensuring comprehensive medical coverage. The couple's income is around $62,000 per year, primarily from her husband's pension and their combined social security benefits.\n\nLiving in a single-family home they own outright, Agnes and her husband have no mortgage but face rising property taxes and maintenance costs. Their economic concerns include the increasing cost of healthcare for her aging parents and themselves, as well as the challenge of accessing specialized medical services in their rural area. Agnes's political priorities include support for veterans, improvement of rural healthcare services, and protection of social security benefits."
