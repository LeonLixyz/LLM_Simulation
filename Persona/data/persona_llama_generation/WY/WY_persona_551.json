  "PERSONA": "Meet Evelyn Johnson, a 62-year-old African American woman who resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder of her household, Evelyn has recently become a widow after her husband's passing. She speaks English fluently, having been born and raised in the United States, specifically in the state of Louisiana, which she left over a decade ago to settle in Wyoming with her late husband.\n\nEvelyn's educational background includes two years of college, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. This educational foundation, however, has been instrumental in her career trajectory. She has worked as an administrative assistant for over 20 years, with her most recent position being at a local insurance company in Cheyenne, where she earned an annual income of $43,000.\n\nEvelyn owns a modest, single-family home in a quiet suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which she and her husband purchased in 2008. The mortgage, now solely her responsibility, is $1,200 per month, a significant expense but manageable given her steady income and the couple's prudent financial planning before his passing.\n\nGiven her marital status as a widow, Evelyn's household income has decreased significantly, making economic stability and security her top priorities. She is concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, especially healthcare and housing, and is keenly interested in policies that could alleviate these burdens for seniors and widows. Her economic concerns also extend to social security benefits and pension plans, as she relies on these for part of her income.\n\nEvelyn's political views are shaped by her experiences as a widow, her career in administration, and her observations of the economic challenges faced by seniors in her community. She values policies that support affordable healthcare, protect social security, and promote economic opportunities for women and minorities. Despite the challenges she faces, Evelyn remains optimistic about her future and is actively engaged in her community, volunteering at a local women's empowerment group and participating in town hall meetings to voice her opinions on issues that matter to her and her community."
