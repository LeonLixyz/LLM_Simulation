  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 62-year-old white female residing in a small town in Wyoming. As a primary householder, Karen lives alone in a modest, single-story home she owns in the outskirts of Cheyenne, the state capital. She has been widowed for about five years, following the passing of her husband due to a long illness.\n\nKaren was born in Nebraska but moved to Wyoming 15 years ago to be closer to her husband's family. She holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from a local community college in Nebraska, which she obtained before moving to Wyoming. This education has served her well in her career as an administrative assistant at a small insurance firm in downtown Cheyenne. She earns a steady income of $45,000 annually, which allows her to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, albeit with some financial constraints.\n\nAs a homeowner, Karen's mortgage payments are manageable, thanks to her husband's life insurance policy, which helped pay off a significant portion of their home loan. Her monthly mortgage payment is $800, and she also pays $150 for property taxes. She rents out a small guest house on her property to a young professional for $500 a month, which helps supplement her income.\n\nKaren's economic concerns include managing her retirement savings, as she hopes to retire within the next five years. She contributes 10% of her income to a 401(k) plan and is worried about the impact of potential changes to social security benefits on her retirement plans. Healthcare is another significant concern for Karen, as she has a pre-existing condition and relies on her employer-sponsored health insurance.\n\nKaren's primary source of news and information is local television and newspapers, as well as online news websites. She values community involvement and volunteers at a local animal shelter on weekends. Her social circle consists of friends from work, her book club, and acquaintances from the animal shelter.\n\nKaren's living situation, economic priorities, and concerns about retirement and healthcare make her a unique individual with distinct economic and political views. Her experiences as a widowed, single homeowner in a rural state like Wyoming shape her perspectives on issues like social security, healthcare, and economic development."
