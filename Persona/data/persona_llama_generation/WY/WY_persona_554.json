  "PERSONA": "Maria Rodriguez, a 49-year-old, US-born, white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of her single-person household and has been divorced for about five years. Maria is a non-veteran and a US citizen by birth, having moved to Wyoming from her birth state of New Mexico about seven years ago for work.\n\nMaria holds an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education from a community college in New Mexico. She works as a Preschool Teacher at a local private school in Cheyenne, with a gross annual income of $43,000. She has been working at this job for about six years and has seen a modest 10% increase in her salary over the past five years, mainly due to her additional coursework in special education.\n\nAs the primary householder, Maria rents a cozy, one-bedroom apartment in a quiet neighborhood close to her workplace for $900 per month. She owns a 2018 Honda Civic with about 70,000 miles, which she bought used three years ago for $18,000. She has a moderate credit score of 680 and has been working to pay off her remaining $10,000 in student loan debt.\n\nMaria's primary language is Spanish, and she speaks English less than very well. However, she has been taking English language courses at a local community center to improve her proficiency. She values bilingual education and cultural diversity, which is reflected in her work with young children.\n\nMaria's economic concerns include saving for retirement, as she is not confident about her current employer's pension plan. She also hopes to own a home in the future, but her current income and debt make it challenging. Maria is interested in local policies that support education and affordable housing, as she believes these are crucial for the well-being of her community."
