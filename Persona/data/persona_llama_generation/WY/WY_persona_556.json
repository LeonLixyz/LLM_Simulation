  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Rachel Jenkins, a US-born citizen living in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming. As a divorced woman, Rachel shares a household with her new partner, who is the primary household earner. Rachel's educational background is limited, having dropped out of high school in the 9th grade due to family circumstances. Despite this, she has worked hard to acquire skills in the service industry, currently employed as a waitress at a local diner, earning approximately $25,000 per year.\n\nRachel's partner, a construction worker, has a more stable income of around $50,000 annually, which helps support their household. They rent a modest, two-bedroom apartment in a working-class neighborhood, paying about $800 per month. Rachel's primary responsibility is caring for her 10-year-old son from her previous marriage, who lives with them full-time.\n\nRachel's limited education has impacted her career trajectory, but she is determined to improve her situation. She is currently taking online courses to obtain her GED, hoping to eventually enroll in a vocational program to become a dental assistant. This career change would not only increase her earning potential but also provide a sense of personal fulfillment.\n\nRachel's economic concerns are centered around providing a stable future for her son, ensuring he has access to quality education, and creating a secure financial foundation for their family. She is worried about the rising costs of healthcare and education in Wyoming, as well as the state's limited job opportunities. Rachel's political views are shaped by her experiences as a single mother and her desire for policies that support working-class families, affordable education, and accessible healthcare.\n\nRachel's daily life revolves around her job, caring for her son, and pursuing her educational goals. She values simplicity, hard work, and community, often participating in local events and volunteering at her son's school. Despite the challenges she faces, Rachel remains optimistic about her future and is committed to creating a better life for herself and her family."
