  "PERSONA": "A 22-year-old white male, named Tyler, who is the primary householder of a single-person household in Casper, Wyoming. He is married but currently separated from his spouse, due to work-related relocation issues. Tyler was born in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming, and is a U.S. citizen by birth. He speaks only English and has no reported veteran status.\n\nTyler completed his high school education in Casper and pursued higher education at Casper College, where he completed about two years of coursework in business administration before dropping out to take on a full-time job. He currently works as a sales representative for an agricultural equipment supplier in Casper, with a gross annual income of $43,000.\n\nTyler rents a one-bedroom apartment in the downtown area of Casper, paying $900 per month, and has a car loan for his 2018 Ford F-150, which he uses for both personal and work-related travel. His economic concerns include paying off his student loans, which total around $15,000, and saving up for a down payment on a house.\n\nTyler's marital status as \"now married, except separated\" reflects his situation where he and his wife, whom he married in 2020, are currently living apart due to her job in a neighboring town. They maintain a long-distance relationship and are working on reconciling their living situation. This separation affects Tyler's economic priorities, as he has to balance his personal expenses with supporting his wife's education pursuits.\n\nTyler's location in Casper, Wyoming, a city with a relatively low cost of living, influences his economic views, with a focus on local economic development, job security, and affordable housing. His experience working in the agricultural sector also shapes his opinions on environmental policies, trade agreements, and government subsidies for farmers."
