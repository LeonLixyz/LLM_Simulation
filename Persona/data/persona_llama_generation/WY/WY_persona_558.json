  "PERSONA": "Meet Rosa Elena Garc\u00eda, a 69-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States. She resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in a single-family home that she owns with her late husband, who passed away three years ago. Rosa is a widow and lives alone in the house they purchased in 2001 for $180,000, which is now valued at approximately $340,000. Her household income consists of her late husband's pension, her own retirement benefits, and income from renting out their vacation home in Casper, Wyoming, totaling around $65,000 per year.\n\nRosa holds a Master's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in 1985. She spent most of her career as a high school teacher, teaching Spanish and history in the Cheyenne school district for 30 years before retiring in 2015. Her experience as a veteran stems from her service in the US Army Reserve from 1975 to 1981, where she worked as a medical administrative specialist.\n\nAs a widow, Rosa's primary economic concerns are managing her household expenses on a fixed income, ensuring she has enough savings for potential healthcare costs, and maintaining her home's value. Her late husband's pension and her own retirement benefits provide a relatively stable financial situation, but she is mindful of inflation and the rising costs of living in Wyoming.\n\nRosa is fluent in English and has no difficulties communicating in her daily life. She values her independence and takes pride in her ability to manage her finances and maintain her home. Rosa's educational background and career have instilled in her a strong appreciation for the importance of education and public service, which influences her political views and priorities."
