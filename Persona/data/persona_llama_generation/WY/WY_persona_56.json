  "PERSONA": "Jessica Thompson is a 48-year-old White female, a primary householder residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married but separated and lives alone in a one-bedroom apartment, which she rents for $1,200 per month. Born in Colorado, Jessica moved to Wyoming 10 years ago for her job as a Fire Marshal with the City of Cheyenne Fire Department, where she earns $85,000 annually. She holds an Associate's degree in Fire Science from a local community college, which has been instrumental in her career advancement.\n\nJessica's educational background and career path are closely intertwined. After completing high school, she attended a community college, initially planning to pursue a degree in Emergency Medical Services (EMS). However, after volunteering at her local fire department, she decided to switch to Fire Science, a decision that led to her current role. Her experience in the fire department has been rewarding, but the physical demands and shift work have taken a toll on her personal life, contributing to her current marital separation.\n\nJessica is a US citizen, born and raised in the United States, and speaks only English. She is not a veteran but values the service of those in the military and often participates in local charity events to support veterans. She is covered by private health insurance through her employer, which she appreciates for its comprehensive coverage.\n\nJessica's income places her in a comfortable position economically, but she is conscious of her expenses. She allocates her income carefully, prioritizing saving for retirement and paying off her student loans. She is concerned about the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly the increasing rent prices, and hopes that local policymakers will address these issues to maintain the city's affordability.\n\nGiven her career in public service and her personal economic situation, Jessica is likely to prioritize policies that support public servants, address affordable housing, and ensure comprehensive healthcare coverage. Her experience as a woman in a traditionally male-dominated field also makes her keenly aware of gender equality issues in the workplace and beyond."
