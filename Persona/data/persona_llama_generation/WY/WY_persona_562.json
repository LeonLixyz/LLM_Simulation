He is married to his high school sweetheart, Emily, whom he met in their senior year. They have a 3-year-old daughter named Lily.

However, he is also concerned about the limited job opportunities and the impact of tourism on the local economy. He often engages in discussions with his friends and family about the need for sustainable economic growth that benefits the local community.\n\nAlex and his family are proud of their Wyoming heritage, and they frequently participate in local events and traditions. They are also avid supporters of the local school system and often volunteer at school events. As a young family man, Alex's economic and political views are shaped by his desire to provide a stable and secure future for his family, while also contributing to the well-being of his community."
