  "PERSONA": "Alex Thompson, a 39-year-old white male, living in a small apartment in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder and has never been married, with no children. Born in Montana, Alex moved to Wyoming for work about 5 years ago and is a US citizen by birth.\n\nAssuming his English proficiency is high due to being born and raised in the US and speaking English only, it is reasonable to infer that Alex's ethnicity is non-Hispanic, given the lack of specified ethnicity in the metadata.\n\nAlex graduated from high school in Montana but did not pursue higher education due to financial constraints and a desire to enter the workforce early. He works as a maintenance technician at a local manufacturing plant, earning $55,000 per year. This job provides him with a stable income but limited opportunities for career advancement, which is a concern for him.\n\nAlex rents a one-bedroom apartment in a modest neighborhood in Cheyenne for $800 per month. He does not own a home due to his moderate income and prioritizes saving for retirement and emergencies over saving for a down payment on a house.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Alex does not have any specific benefits or experiences associated with military service. His primary economic concerns are affording healthcare, saving for retirement, and managing the increasing cost of living in Wyoming, particularly housing costs. Politically, Alex is likely to support policies that address these concerns, such as affordable healthcare initiatives and programs aimed at making homeownership more accessible to middle-class Americans."
