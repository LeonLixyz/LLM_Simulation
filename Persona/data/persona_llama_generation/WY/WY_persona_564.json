  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 22-year-old white female, born in Oregon but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with her husband. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed two years ago. Emily works as an Environmental Coordinator for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, earning an annual salary of $48,000. She is fluent in English, having grown up speaking it as her primary language, and identifies as a US citizen by birth.\n\nEmily and her husband, Alex, a 25-year-old software engineer, have been married for three years and rent a two-bedroom apartment in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne. Their rent is $1,200 per month, and they share a car, a 2018 Honda Civic. Emily's husband earns a significantly higher income, $85,000 per year, working for a tech firm in Cheyenne.\n\nEmily's educational background has been a significant factor in her career choice and trajectory. She developed a passion for environmental conservation during her undergraduate studies, which led her to pursue a career in the field. Her current role involves working with local communities and organizations to develop and implement sustainable practices.\n\nAs a homeowner-aspirant, Emily and her husband are currently saving for a down payment on a house. They hope to purchase a home in the next three years, which is a significant economic priority for them. Their economic concerns include managing student loan debt, building an emergency fund, and navigating the challenges of homeownership in Wyoming's relatively expensive housing market.\n\nGiven her background and current situation, Emily's economic views tend to lean towards conservative fiscal policies, with an emphasis on environmental sustainability and community development. She is likely to support local initiatives and policies that promote eco-friendly practices and affordable housing options."
