  "PERSONA": "Meet Evelyn Thompson, a 79-year-old white female living in the small town of Jackson, Wyoming. As the primary householder, she resides alone in a modest, two-bedroom home she owns outright in a quiet neighborhood near the town center. Evelyn has never married and does not have any children.\n\nEvelyn was born in Iowa but moved to Wyoming over 40 years ago, attracted by the state's natural beauty and slower pace of life. She is a U.S. citizen by birth and speaks English fluently, having never spoken another language at home.\n\nEvelyn's educational background is rooted in traditional American values; she is a high school graduate, having completed her diploma from her local high school in Iowa. While she did not pursue higher education, she values the importance of learning and has taken various community college courses over the years to stay engaged and curious.\n\nProfessionally, Evelyn worked as a librarian at the local Jackson library for over two decades before retiring at the age of 65. Her job not only provided her with a stable income but also allowed her to be part of the community, which she deeply values. Her annual retirement income is approximately $45,000, which she supplements with occasional freelance writing for local publications, leveraging her love of reading and writing.\n\nEvelyn's economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs and the rising cost of living in Jackson, which she feels is becoming increasingly unaffordable for seniors on fixed incomes. She is particularly worried about potential changes to Medicare and Social Security, as these programs are crucial to her financial security. Despite these concerns, Evelyn remains optimistic about her situation and is proactive in seeking assistance from local non-profits and community resources designed to support seniors.\n\nEvelyn's living situation is comfortable, with her home being her most valuable asset. She has no mortgage, which significantly reduces her living expenses. However, she does worry about the maintenance costs associated with owning a home, especially as she ages and may require more assistance.\n\nPolitically, Evelyn's views are moderate, reflecting her conservative upbringing in the Midwest combined with her experiences living in a state with a strong libertarian streak. She values independence, hard work, and community support, which influences her views on economic and social policies. Evelyn is a regular voter and stays informed through local news and discussions at community gatherings."
