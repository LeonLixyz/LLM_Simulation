  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old white female, born in Oregon but currently living in her hometown of Casper, Wyoming, with her parents due to financial constraints. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Jason, who works as a mechanic in a local garage. They have no children but are planning to start a family soon.\n\nAlex graduated from Natrona County High School and briefly attended Casper College but did not complete her degree due to financial difficulties. She currently works part-time as a waitress at a local diner, earning around $25,000 per year. Her husband's income from the garage is around $45,000 annually, making their combined household income approximately $70,000.\n\nLiving with her parents helps reduce their living expenses, as they pay no rent but contribute to household bills. Her parents own the house, which is valued at around $180,000, reflecting the modest but stable housing market in Casper. Alex and Jason hope to save enough money to move into their own home within the next few years.\n\nGiven her situation, Alex's economic concerns are primarily focused on saving for a down payment on a house, managing their current debt (which includes Jason's car loan and their combined credit card debt of about $5,000), and planning for the future expenses associated with starting a family. Her political views are likely influenced by her desire for economic stability, affordable healthcare, and access to quality education for her future children."
