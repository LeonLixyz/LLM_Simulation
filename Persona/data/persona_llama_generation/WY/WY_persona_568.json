  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old James \"Jim\" Thompson, a retired high school graduate living in a rural area of Wyoming with his wife, Karen. As the primary householder, Jim is now married to Karen for 42 years and they have no children together. Born in Wyoming, Jim has always been a US citizen and identifies as White, with no specified ethnicity. \n\nJim grew up in a small town in Wyoming, graduated from a local high school, and never pursued higher education. After high school, he worked as a mechanic in a local garage for over 30 years before retiring at 62. Jim's annual retirement income from his pension and social security is around $45,000. His wife, Karen, 65, also contributes to their household income with a part-time job at a local bakery, earning approximately $15,000 per year. \n\nTheir combined income allows them to live comfortably in their modest, fully-paid-off home valued at $180,000. Their home is located in a rural area with limited public transportation options, making their two cars essential for daily errands and visiting family and friends. Jim spends most of his free time maintaining his home, gardening, and volunteering at the local animal shelter.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of Wyoming, Jim is deeply rooted in the community and has a strong connection to the outdoors, which influences his economic concerns, particularly when it comes to environmental and conservation policies. His economic priorities include maintaining a stable retirement income, keeping healthcare costs affordable, and ensuring access to quality healthcare services in rural areas."
