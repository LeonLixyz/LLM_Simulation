  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Moreno, a 28-year-old Mexican-American woman who is the primary householder of her family in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Despite being listed as \"Never married\" due to a technicality, Ana is in a long-term, committed relationship with her partner, Juan, and they have two children together, aged 4 and 6. This discrepancy in marital status might be attributed to the couple's decision to delay formalizing their union due to financial constraints or personal preference.\n\nAna holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2018. Her graduate education has enabled her to secure a well-paying job as an Environmental Consultant at a local firm specializing in sustainable practices for the oil and gas industry, a sector that is prominent in Wyoming. Her annual income is approximately $65,000, which is above the median household income in Cheyenne.\n\nAs the primary breadwinner, Ana's income supports her family's comfortable lifestyle. They rent a three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne for $1,200 per month, which is relatively affordable given the local housing market. The family's economic situation is stable, with Ana's partner, Juan, contributing an additional $30,000 per year from his job as a freelance graphic designer. This dual-income household allows them to save for their children's education and plan for homeownership in the future.\n\nAna's educational background and career trajectory are significant factors in shaping her economic and political views. As an environmental consultant, she is deeply concerned about climate change and its implications for Wyoming's economy, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Her professional experience has also made her aware of the need for sustainable practices and the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection.\n\nGiven her family's economic stability and her own educational achievements, Ana is likely to prioritize policies that support education, environmental protection, and economic diversification in Wyoming. Her concerns about the future, particularly regarding her children's well-being and the state's economic resilience, influence her political views and voting decisions."
