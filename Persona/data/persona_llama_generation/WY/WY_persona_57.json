  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 57-year-old Mexican-American male residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the spouse of the household, Juan lives with his wife, Maria, in a modest two-bedroom home in a working-class neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. They have been married for over 25 years, and their children have moved out, allowing them to enjoy a quieter life.\n\nJuan was born in Wyoming to Mexican immigrant parents, who settled in the state for work in the agriculture sector. Growing up, he learned English as his primary language at home and in school, though he still understands some Spanish from his parents. He attended a local community college for two years, studying automotive repair but did not graduate due to financial constraints.\n\nJuan works as a heavy equipment operator at a local quarry, a job he has held for over a decade. His annual income is around $125,000, which, combined with his wife's income as a part-time nurse, provides a relatively comfortable life. However, despite their combined income, they struggle with healthcare costs, as Juan lacks health insurance coverage through his employer and cannot afford private insurance.\n\nAs a result of his job and income, Juan is deeply concerned about economic stability, job security, and access to affordable healthcare. He supports policies that promote job growth in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors and advocates for affordable healthcare options for working-class families. His experiences have made him skeptical of politicians who promise but fail to deliver on these issues.\n\nJuan and his wife own their home, which they purchased in the early 2000s. They have seen their neighborhood undergo gentrification, with rising property values and increasing costs of living. This has made them consider moving to a more affordable area but are hesitant due to their strong community ties.\n\nIn his free time, Juan enjoys outdoor activities like hunting and fishing, which Wyoming's vast wilderness offers. He is also an avid fan of the Denver Broncos and spends Sundays watching football with friends and family. Despite his busy schedule, Juan prioritizes family time and often helps his wife with her part-time job, driving her to shifts or assisting with errands.\n\nJuan's economic situation and lack of health insurance coverage significantly influence his political views. He tends to support candidates who prioritize working-class issues, economic growth, and affordable healthcare, even if it means compromising on other issues."
