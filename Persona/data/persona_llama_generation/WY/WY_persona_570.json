Alex is married to her husband, Ryan, whom she met in college, but they currently reside in a shared house with two other non-related individuals due to the high cost of living in the area.

Alex holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2018. She was born in Oregon but moved to Wyoming for college and decided to stay due to her love for the outdoors and the job opportunities in her field.
