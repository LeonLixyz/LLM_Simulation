  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson, a 79-year-old white female and primary householder living in a single-family home in the outskirts of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Arizona, Agnes moved to Wyoming 10 years ago for retirement. As a veteran, she served in the Women's Army Corps (WAC) for four years during the Vietnam War era, working as an administrative assistant. After her service, Agnes pursued an Associate's degree in Business Administration from a local community college and worked as an office manager for a small insurance firm in Arizona for over two decades.\n\nAssuming Agnes never married due to her focus on her career and personal independence, she has no children but has a close-knit group of friends from her veteran community and book club. Agnes owns her home, a modest two-bedroom ranch-style house with a small garden, which she maintains herself. Her annual household income is around $43,000, consisting of her veteran's pension ($25,000), social security benefits ($12,000), and part-time work as a library assistant ($6,000).\n\nGiven her economic situation, Agnes's primary concerns include maintaining her healthcare coverage, particularly for her arthritis and hypertension, and ensuring the stability of her pension and social security benefits. She is also concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly property taxes and heating costs during the harsh winters. As a homeowner, Agnes is invested in local property tax policies and state-level decisions affecting veterans' benefits and healthcare access. Her experiences as a veteran and a single, older adult without family support also make her sensitive to issues of social isolation and community resources for seniors."
