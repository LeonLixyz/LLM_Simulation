  "PERSONA": "Meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 57-year-old White female who resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, she lives alone in a modest, rented condominium in the historic downtown area. Alex was born in Wyoming and has spent most of her life in the state, which she deeply loves for its natural beauty and close-knit communities.\n\nAlex's marital status is separated, having been married for about 15 years before the separation. Despite the separation, she maintains a cordial relationship with her ex-husband for the sake of their adult children, who are now pursuing their careers in other states. This family dynamic has instilled in Alex a strong sense of independence and self-reliance.\n\nProfessionally, Alex works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local non-profit organization focused on environmental conservation. Her job title is Administrative Coordinator, and she has been with the organization for about five years. Alex's annual income is around $42,000, which, combined with her modest lifestyle, allows her to live comfortably within her means. She does not own a home due to financial constraints but hopes to purchase a property in the near future.\n\nAlex holds an associate's degree in environmental science from Laramie County Community College, which she obtained after attending some college but not completing her bachelor's degree. Her educational background has been instrumental in securing her current role and fostering her passion for environmental issues.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex is deeply concerned about the economic implications of environmental policies on her community, particularly regarding the balance between conservation and the energy sector, which is a significant contributor to the state's economy. Her primary economic concerns include job security, affordable healthcare, and the preservation of Wyoming's natural beauty for future generations.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking in the nearby mountains, practicing yoga, and volunteering at local community events. She is fluent in English and speaks some Spanish, which she learned during her college years. Alex values her independence, the outdoors, and community engagement, which significantly influence her economic and political views."
