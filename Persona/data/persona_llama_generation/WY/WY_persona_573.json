  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Elena Garc\u00eda, a 38-year-old Mexican-American woman living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, she shares a household with her partner, Juan, and their two children, ages 7 and 9. Despite being in a long-term, committed relationship, Ana and Juan have chosen not to formalize their union through marriage, reflecting a personal choice rather than a lack of commitment to each other or their family.\n\nAna holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed after moving to the state for graduate school. Her educational background has equipped her with a strong foundation in science and policy, leading to a successful career as an Environmental Policy Analyst for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. Her annual income is around $62,000, placing her firmly in the middle class. Ana's job involves working closely with local communities, farmers, and policymakers to develop and implement environmentally sustainable practices across the state.\n\nAna was born in Arizona but moved to Wyoming for her graduate studies and decided to stay due to the state's natural beauty and the career opportunities available. Her proficiency in English, which she speaks fluently, has been invaluable in her professional life, although she also values her Mexican heritage and ensures her children learn Spanish as a second language.\n\nAs a homeowner, Ana has a mortgage on a modest, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, with a monthly payment of around $1,200. This, combined with the costs of raising two children and saving for their future, means that Ana and her partner have to be mindful of their expenses. They prioritize saving for their children's education and ensuring they have a stable financial future.\n\nAna's economic concerns are centered around ensuring her family's financial security, especially in terms of education and healthcare costs. She is keenly interested in policies that support affordable housing, quality public education, and environmental protection. Her professional background and personal life have instilled in her a deep appreciation for policies that balance economic growth with environmental sustainability and social equity."
