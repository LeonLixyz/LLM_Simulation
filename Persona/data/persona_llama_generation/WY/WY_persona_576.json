  "PERSONA": "Meet 57-year-old John Thompson, a native of Wyoming, residing in the small town of Cody, where he lives with his wife, Karen, in a cozy, two-story house they purchased in 2005 for $240,000. As the spouse of the household, John contributes to the family income by working as a Maintenance Supervisor at a local equipment rental company, earning $55,000 annually. He graduated from Cody High School in 1986 and never pursued higher education due to family obligations, starting work at his current company immediately after high school. John has been married to Karen for 30 years, and they have two adult children, Emily (28) and Michael (25), both of whom have moved out of the family home to pursue their careers.\n\nJohn's household income, combined with Karen's part-time job as a librarian, totals $80,000 annually. They have a mortgage of $1,500 per month and own two vehicles, a 2018 Ford F-150 and a 2015 Honda Civic. Their economic priorities include saving for retirement, paying off their mortgage, and ensuring their children are financially stable. John is fluent in English and has never served in the military. He values community involvement, often volunteering at local events and participating in town hall meetings, where he expresses concerns about the economic impact of tourism on the town's infrastructure and the need for better job opportunities for young people."
