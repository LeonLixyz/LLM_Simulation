  "PERSONA": "Meet Margaret 'Margie' Thompson, a 68-year-old white female and primary householder of a married-couple household without kids. Despite being listed as \"Never married\" in her official records, Margie has been in a long-term, committed relationship with her partner, Susan, for over 30 years; they have chosen not to get formally married. Margie is a non-veteran and a US citizen by birth, born in New Hampshire but now residing in Laramie, Wyoming.\n\nMargie's household income is approximately $73,000 per year, primarily from her partner's job as a professor at the University of Wyoming and her own part-time work as a librarian at a local public library. Her annual salary is around $35,000. They own their home in the historic district of Laramie, which they purchased in 2001 for $170,000; the current market value is around $320,000.\n\nMargie holds a Bachelor's degree in Library Science from the University of New Hampshire. She graduated in 1978 and began her career as a librarian in various public libraries in New England before moving to Wyoming with Susan in 1995. Her educational background and career trajectory have provided her with a stable, middle-class lifestyle, allowing her to pursue her passion for local history and genealogy.\n\nMargie's economic concerns include maintaining a comfortable retirement, managing healthcare costs, and preserving the value of their home. As a resident of Wyoming, she is also concerned about the state's reliance on fossil fuels and the impact of climate change on local ecosystems. She is an avid supporter of renewable energy initiatives and conservation efforts in the region.\n\nAs a primary householder, Margie takes pride in her role as a responsible member of her community. She volunteers at the local historical society and participates in neighborhood initiatives to promote sustainable living and environmental stewardship. Her partner, Susan, is also actively involved in local politics, which has sparked Margie's interest in policy discussions and community engagement."
