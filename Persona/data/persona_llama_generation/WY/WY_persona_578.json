  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Barbara Wilson, a retired administrative assistant living in a modest single-family home she owns in the town of Cody, Wyoming. Barbara is a lifelong Wyoming resident, born and raised in the state she loves for its vast open spaces and outdoor recreational opportunities. She is married to her second husband, 70-year-old Jack, a retired mechanic whom she met through mutual friends and married 8 years ago. Jack has two adult children from his previous marriage, but they live out of state, and Barbara does not have any children of her own.\n\nBarbara's educational background includes two years at the University of Wyoming, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree due to financial constraints. Despite this, she had a fulfilling 30-year career as an administrative assistant in various local businesses, including a stint at the Cody Chamber of Commerce. Her last position was at a small law firm, from which she retired 3 years ago.\n\nBarbara's annual household income is approximately $45,000, which includes her retirement savings and Social Security benefits, as well as a part-time income from Jack's occasional handyman work. They own their home outright, having paid off the mortgage several years ago. Their monthly expenses are relatively low, with the main outlays being utilities, groceries, and maintaining their home.\n\nGiven her background and current situation, Barbara's economic concerns are centered around maintaining a comfortable retirement, ensuring access to quality healthcare, and preserving the natural beauty of Wyoming for future generations. She is particularly worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on her Social Security benefits. Her political views tend to lean conservative, reflecting her rural upbringing and the values of self-reliance and individual responsibility that are prevalent in her community. However, she is not averse to supporting policies that protect the environment and promote local economic development, as long as they do not overly burden small businesses or individual taxpayers."
