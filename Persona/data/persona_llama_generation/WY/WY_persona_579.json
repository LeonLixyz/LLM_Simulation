  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old John, a white male living in a rural area of Wyoming. He resides with his 92-year-old mother in a modest, single-family home they've owned for over 20 years in a small town just outside of Cheyenne. John's father passed away 5 years ago, and since then, he has been his mother's primary caregiver, which has become a significant part of his life.\n\nJohn was born in Colorado but moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age. He considers himself a Wyoming native and has a deep affection for the state's wide-open spaces and outdoor lifestyle. He is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently, having grown up in an English-speaking household.\n\nJohn's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied automotive repair. However, he didn't complete his degree, opting instead to enter the workforce early. This decision was largely driven by the need to support himself and contribute to his family's income.\n\nProfessionally, John spent most of his working life as a mechanic, owning a small repair shop in Cheyenne for over 25 years. He took pride in his work, earning a reputation for honesty and reliability among the local community. After selling his business about 5 years ago, John transitioned into semi-retirement, taking on occasional part-time work to keep himself active and supplement his income.\n\nJohn's marital status is divorced, a result of a marriage that lasted about 10 years and ended when he was in his mid-40s. He has no children from the marriage. His focus has been on supporting his mother and engaging in his community, where he's known for his volunteer work at a local animal shelter.\n\nJohn's annual income is around $35,000, which comes from a combination of his part-time work, the sale of his business, and a small pension. He is not a veteran and has never served in the military. Living in a rural area, John values independence and self-sufficiency, which influences his economic and political views. He is concerned about healthcare costs, especially as his mother ages, and the impact of economic policies on small businesses and local communities."
