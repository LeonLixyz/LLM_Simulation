  "PERSONA": "Dorothy \"Dottie\" Thompson, a 68-year-old retired white female, born and raised in Illinois but now residing in a small town in Wyoming. She has been in a long-term, unmarried partnership with her 70-year-old male partner, Jack, for over 20 years. They live together in a cozy, two-bedroom house they own outright in the town of Lander, Wyoming. Their home, valued at around $230,000, is modest but comfortable, reflecting their simple lifestyle. Dottie's education consists of a high school diploma from her hometown in Illinois, after which she entered the workforce directly. \n\nDottie's career spanned over three decades in retail sales, working her way up to a store manager position before deciding to retire at 62. Her retirement income is a combination of her pension from the retail company and social security benefits, totaling around $62,000 annually. Dottie and Jack have no children together but are close to Jack's adult children from a previous marriage, who occasionally visit.\n\nDottie's primary economic concerns are related to healthcare and maintaining her standard of living in retirement. She and Jack rely on Medicare for health insurance, supplemented by a small, private policy to cover out-of-pocket expenses. Given her fixed income, Dottie is keenly aware of inflation's impact on her purchasing power and follows local and national economic policies closely, especially those affecting retirees and healthcare. She votes regularly and is particularly interested in political discussions around social security, healthcare reform, and economic policies that might affect her community in rural Wyoming.\n\nDespite not being in the labor force, Dottie remains active in her community, volunteering at a local thrift store that supports community projects and participating in town hall meetings. Her experiences as a long-term resident of Wyoming, combined with her background in retail, give her a unique perspective on local economic issues and the challenges faced by small businesses in rural areas."
