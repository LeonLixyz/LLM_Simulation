  "PERSONA": "Meet 29-year-old Alexis \"Lexi\" Thompson, a white female and the primary householder of a married couple without kids, residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She was born in Wyoming and has been a US citizen her entire life. Lexi is married to her high school sweetheart, Jake, a 31-year-old mechanic. Despite being married, they do not have any children, which allows them to allocate more resources toward their hobbies and personal development.\n\nLexi's educational background is limited to 8th grade due to her decision to pursue vocational training in cosmetology immediately after. This choice was largely driven by her passion for hairstyling and her desire to start earning an income as soon as possible. She has been working as a hairstylist at a local salon in downtown Cheyenne for the past 7 years, earning an annual income of $38,500. Her job requires strong communication skills, attention to detail, and creativity, which she enjoys.\n\nLexi and Jake rent a cozy, two-bedroom apartment in a moderately priced neighborhood, with a monthly rent of $1,100. They have been renting for 5 years and are currently saving up to buy a house. Their combined household income is around $70,000 per year, with Jake's income supplementing Lexi's as the primary breadwinner. They prioritize saving for a down payment on a house, paying off their car loan, and building an emergency fund.\n\nGiven her limited educational background and reliance on vocational training, Lexi is concerned about the rising costs of higher education and the implications this has on individuals who, like her, chose not to pursue traditional college routes. She is also worried about the impact of economic downturns on small businesses, such as the salon where she works, and the potential for job insecurity.\n\nLexi's economic priorities include affordable housing, access to vocational training programs, and support for small businesses. She believes in the importance of community development and often participates in local events to promote downtown Cheyenne. Her political views are centered around issues that directly affect her daily life, such as job security, affordable healthcare, and education reform."
