  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Susan Thompson, a widowed, white female, and primary householder residing in the small town of Jackson, Wyoming. Susan was born and raised in Wyoming, making her a lifelong resident of the state. She lives in a two-story, three-bedroom house that she and her late husband purchased in 1995 for $120,000. The house, now valued at $350,000, is situated in a suburban neighborhood with a mix of retirees and young families.\n\nSusan has two adult children, both of whom have moved out of the house. Her son, a 32-year-old software engineer, lives in Denver with his wife and two kids, while her 29-year-old daughter is a nurse practitioner in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Despite being empty nesters, Susan's household is often filled with the sounds of her grandchildren during their frequent visits.\n\nSusan's educational background includes two years of study at the University of Wyoming, where she majored in business administration before dropping out to start a family. This educational foundation served her well in her 25-year career as an administrative assistant at a local insurance agency. Although she never completed her degree, Susan's work experience and strong communication skills earned her a comfortable income of $55,000 per year.\n\nAfter her husband's passing three years ago, Susan's annual household income dropped significantly, forcing her to rely on her social security benefits, a modest pension from her former employer, and a part-time job as a receptionist at a nearby doctor's office. Her current annual income is around $40,000.\n\nSusan's economic concerns include maintaining her current standard of living, ensuring she has enough savings for retirement, and keeping her home, which is now a significant portion of her net worth. She is also concerned about the rising cost of healthcare and the impact it may have on her ability to afford medical care as she ages.\n\nPolitically, Susan is a moderate conservative, prioritizing issues like affordable healthcare, education, and local economic development. She values her independence and is cautious of government intervention in personal matters but recognizes the importance of social safety nets, particularly for seniors and low-income families.\n\nIn her free time, Susan enjoys hiking, gardening, and volunteering at the local animal shelter. She is an active member of her community, often participating in town hall meetings and advocating for initiatives that benefit seniors and families in her area."
