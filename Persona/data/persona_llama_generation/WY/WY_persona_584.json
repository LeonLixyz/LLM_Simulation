  "PERSONA": "John Lee, a 49-year-old white male who has been experiencing homelessness for the past two years. Born in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming, John grew up in a small town near Cheyenne. He has no reported ethnicity and speaks English as his primary language, which he speaks well.\n\nJohn's educational background includes an Associate's degree in automotive repair, which he earned from a local community college in Wyoming. After completing his degree, he worked as an auto mechanic in various garages around Cheyenne. However, due to a series of unfortunate events, including a divorce and a decline in the local automotive industry, John found himself struggling to maintain stable employment and eventually lost his home.\n\nCurrently, John resides in a homeless shelter in downtown Cheyenne, where he shares a room with three other individuals. Despite his challenging situation, John remains hopeful about his future and is actively seeking employment opportunities. His economic concerns are centered around finding stable, well-paying work that would allow him to save enough money to secure permanent housing.\n\nJohn's divorce was finalized about five years ago, and he has limited contact with his ex-wife, who has custody of their two children, now aged 12 and 15. He tries to stay involved in their lives as much as possible but faces significant financial constraints that limit his ability to provide for them.\n\nJohn's lack of stable housing and employment has significantly impacted his economic situation, making him reliant on local non-profit organizations and government assistance programs to get by. He is eager to regain stability and become financially independent, which would enable him to re-establish a more meaningful connection with his children and rebuild his life."
