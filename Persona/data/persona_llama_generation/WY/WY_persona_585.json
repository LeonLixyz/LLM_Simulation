  "PERSONA": "Meet Jorge Hernandez, a 62-year-old male who identifies as White and American Indian and Alaska Native, reflecting his mixed heritage from his mother's side, who was of Native American descent. He has never been married and lives with his aging parents in a small, single-family home in Casper, Wyoming. Jorge's parents, both in their early 80s, own the home, which they've had for over 30 years. Jorge contributes to the household income by working as a part-time handyman for a local property management company, earning $25,000 annually. He graduated from Natrona County High School in 1979 and never pursued higher education due to family obligations and financial constraints.\n\nAs a high school graduate, Jorge's job opportunities have been limited, and he has had to rely on his manual skills to make a living. He has been working in the handyman role for over 10 years, which provides him with a stable, albeit modest, income. Jorge's language proficiency in English is limited, and he prefers to speak Spanish, which he learned from his father, who immigrated to the United States from Mexico in the 1950s. Despite his limited English proficiency, Jorge has managed to navigate his daily life and work responsibilities without significant difficulties.\n\nJorge's economic concerns are centered around supporting his aging parents, who are nearing the end of their working lives. He worries about their healthcare costs, as they rely on Medicare and supplemental insurance to cover their expenses. Jorge also struggles to make ends meet, as his part-time income is barely enough to cover his personal expenses, let alone contribute significantly to the household income. He has considered taking on additional work or pursuing vocational training to improve his job prospects, but his primary focus remains on caring for his parents.\n\nGeographically, Jorge's location in Casper, Wyoming, presents both opportunities and challenges. The cost of living in Casper is relatively low compared to other parts of the country, which helps stretch his limited income. However, the local economy is heavily reliant on the energy industry, which can be volatile. Jorge is concerned about the impact of economic downturns on his job security and the overall well-being of his community.\n\nPolitically, Jorge tends to vote along party lines, supporting candidates who prioritize social safety nets, affordable healthcare, and job creation programs. He is particularly interested in policies that address the needs of rural communities, such as infrastructure development and access to quality healthcare services. As a non-veteran, Jorge does not have a direct connection to military issues, but he respects the sacrifices made by those who have served and supports policies that benefit veterans."
