  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 29-year-old widowed white female, living in the small town of Sheridan, Wyoming. She is a veteran, having served four years in the US Army as a logistics specialist. Alex was born in Oklahoma but moved to Wyoming after her husband, a fellow veteran, was stationed at the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. They settled in Sheridan, where they bought a modest two-bedroom house on the outskirts of town. After her husband's passing in a training accident, Alex struggled to maintain the mortgage payments but managed to keep the house by taking on a second job.\n\nAlex's educational background includes completing two years of a business administration program at a community college in Oklahoma before joining the military. She had planned to finish her degree upon returning to civilian life, but her husband's passing and the need to support herself put those plans on hold. She currently works as an administrative assistant at a local insurance agency, earning $32,000 per year. Her second job, working part-time as a waitress at a local diner, adds another $10,000 to her annual income.\n\nAs a widow, Alex faces significant economic challenges, particularly with managing the mortgage and dealing with the aftermath of her husband's military service-related benefits. She is keenly aware of veterans' issues, especially regarding healthcare and financial support for widows and orphans. Her economic concerns include affording healthcare, paying off her mortgage, and saving for retirement. Given her situation, Alex prioritizes policies that support veterans' families, affordable healthcare, and education opportunities that could improve her career prospects.\n\nAlex's experience as a veteran and a widow in a small town influences her political views, focusing on community support, veterans' rights, and economic stability for middle-class families. She values independence and self-sufficiency, reflecting the ethos of her adopted state of Wyoming. Despite her personal challenges, Alex remains optimistic about her future and is determined to make the most of her situation, seeking opportunities for personal and professional growth."
