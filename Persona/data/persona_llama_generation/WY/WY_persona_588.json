  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 49-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Mark, and they have two children, Emily (19) and Ryan (16). Karen's household is a nuclear family unit, with her spouse being the primary household earner. She has been married for over 25 years, and they are currently living in a mortgaged, single-family home valued at approximately $280,000, which they've owned for the past 15 years. \n\nKaren's highest level of educational attainment is 11th grade. She dropped out of high school in her junior year due to pregnancy with her first child but has since taken various vocational courses and workshops, mostly related to childcare and office administration. She currently works part-time as a receptionist at a local dental clinic, earning around $28,000 per year. Her husband, Mark, works full-time as an electrician, earning around $60,000 annually.\n\nKaren's family income is approximately $88,000, placing them in the middle-class category in Wyoming. Despite this, they struggle with saving for their children's college education and paying off their mortgage, which is their primary economic concern. They rent out a small apartment above their garage on Airbnb to supplement their income, especially during the peak tourist season.\n\nKaren's primary language is English, and she speaks it fluently. Born and raised in Wyoming, she has a strong sense of community and is involved in local volunteer work, particularly with the Casper Food Bank and her children's school. She has never served in the military and does not have any immediate family members who have served.\n\nGiven her background, Karen's economic priorities include affordable healthcare, education, and housing. She is also concerned about the impact of climate change on local businesses and the overall economy of Wyoming. Politically, she leans conservative due to her upbringing and the dominant political views in her community but is open to liberal views on social issues like education and healthcare."
