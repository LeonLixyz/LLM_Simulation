  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 68-year-old woman, identifies as White and American Indian and Alaska Native. She resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state's capital and largest city, in a moderately sized, single-story home in a mixed neighborhood with a mix of retirees and families. Emily is a divorced non-veteran who lives with her widowed sister, serving as the primary caregiver and support system. Her high school diploma from a local institution in her birth state of Montana has been the foundation of her career, mainly working as an administrative assistant in various small businesses.\n\nEmily's current annual income is approximately $42,000, largely derived from a combination of her part-time job at a local library and her modest retirement savings. She owns her vehicle, a 2015 Honda Civic, which is essential for her daily commute and running errands for her sister. The sisters share the expenses of their home, including the mortgage, utilities, and maintenance, which Emily's sister primarily covers with her late husband's pension.\n\nEmily is fluent in English, having been born and raised in the United States. She values education and often participates in local community events focused on literacy and cultural heritage preservation. Her economic concerns include managing her retirement savings to ensure a stable financial future, particularly with the rising costs of healthcare and living expenses in her area. Given her experience and close relationship with her sister, Emily also prioritizes accessible, affordable healthcare options and social services for seniors in her community.\n\nEmily's location in Wyoming, a state known for its conservative leanings, influences her moderate political views, which tend to balance economic pragmatism with social compassion, particularly regarding issues affecting seniors, education, and local community development."
