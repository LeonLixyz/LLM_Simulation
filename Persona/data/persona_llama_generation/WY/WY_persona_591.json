  "PERSONA": "Ana\u00efs Rodriguez, a 57-year-old US-born woman of mixed Native American and Latin American descent, identifying as \"Some Other Race.\" She currently resides with her parents in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ana\u00efs is married to her husband, Juan, whom she met in graduate school, but they have decided to live with her parents temporarily due to financial constraints.\n\nAna\u00efs holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming and works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm, specializing in sustainability projects for small businesses and farms. Her annual income is around $62,000. Her husband, Juan, works remotely as a software engineer, earning approximately $80,000 per year.\n\nAna\u00efs and Juan have a 10-year-old son, Mateo, who attends a local public elementary school. The family's living situation with Ana\u00efs' parents allows them to share childcare responsibilities and reduce living expenses, as they plan to save for a down payment on a house in the next few years.\n\nAna\u00efs' parents, both retired, own the suburban home where they live. Her father, a retired mechanic, and her mother, a former librarian, provide valuable support to the family, especially with childcare and household chores.\n\nAna\u00efs is fluent in English, having grown up in the US, and speaks it well. She was born in Arizona but moved to Wyoming with her family at a young age. Her economic concerns include saving for her son's education, paying off her student loans, and eventually becoming a homeowner. Ana\u00efs and her family enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking and camping, which is easily accessible in Wyoming's natural landscapes.\n\nAssumptions made: \n- Based on the \"Some Other Race\" category and the US-born status, a mixed Native American and Latin American descent was assumed for diversity and to reflect the complexity of racial identity in the US.\n- Ana\u00efs' household type is assumed to be a multigenerational household, given that she lives with her parents.\n- Ana\u00efs' specific job title and sector were chosen to align with her graduate degree in Environmental Science and to reflect the economic landscape of Wyoming."
