  "PERSONA": "Emily Johnson is a 69-year-old, white female who lives with her 92-year-old mother in a single-family home in a rural area of Casper, Wyoming. She never married and has no children of her own, dedicating her life to caring for her mother and managing the household. Emily's father passed away 10 years ago, and since then, she has been the primary caregiver and decision-maker for her mother.\n\nEmily dropped out of high school in the 11th grade to work and support her family. She worked as a waitress for over 30 years at a local diner, where she developed strong communication skills and a strong work ethic. After the diner closed down due to the economic downturn, Emily took a part-time job as a housekeeper at a nearby motel, which she held until she turned 65 and decided to focus on caring for her mother full-time.\n\nEmily's household income is limited, relying on her mother's Social Security benefits ($1,800/month) and her own modest savings. They own their home, which is valued at $120,000, but have a mortgage with 10 years remaining. Emily is concerned about the rising cost of living, particularly healthcare and prescription medication costs, which have become a significant burden for her mother.\n\nEmily's economic priorities are ensuring her mother's well-being, paying off their mortgage, and maintaining their home. She is worried about the impact of potential changes to Social Security and Medicare on their household income and access to healthcare. Emily is also concerned about the lack of job opportunities and the struggling local economy in Casper, which she believes affects the overall quality of life for seniors like herself and her mother.\n\nIn terms of education, Emily regrets not finishing high school but is proud of her self-taught skills in managing a household and caring for her mother. She believes that her life experiences have provided her with valuable knowledge and skills that are often overlooked in today's society.\n\nEmily's living situation and family responsibilities have shaped her economic and political views. She is likely to support policies that prioritize senior care, affordable healthcare, and economic development in rural areas. Her experiences as a caregiver have also made her an advocate for programs that support family caregivers and provide resources for seniors."
