  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Akua Owusu, a Black or African American woman, born in Ghana, West Africa, but raised in Latin America, specifically in Panama, where her family relocated when she was a child. She is now a resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming, having moved to the United States five years ago for better job opportunities and to join her husband, who is a U.S. citizen. As a non-citizen, Akua holds a green card and is in the process of becoming a U.S. citizen.\n\nAkua is a high school graduate from a reputable international school in Panama. Although she had ambitions to pursue higher education, family financial constraints led her to enter the workforce immediately after completing high school. Her first job was as an administrative assistant in a small import-export firm, where she honed her English language skills, which she speaks fluently. Akua's proficiency in English, along with her organizational skills, has been instrumental in her career.\n\nAkua works as an office manager for a mid-sized construction company in Cheyenne, earning a salary of $52,000 annually. Her job involves managing day-to-day operations, coordinating with clients, and overseeing administrative tasks. Her husband, Kwame, works as an engineer in the same company, and together they have a combined household income of $120,000.\n\nThe couple rents a three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, paying $1,400 per month. They are planning to save enough to buy a house in the next two years, as they feel it would be a more cost-effective option in the long run. Akua and Kwame have two children, ages 6 and 8, who attend a local public school.\n\nAkua's economic concerns revolve around saving for her children's education, paying off debts, and managing the rising cost of living in the United States. As a non-citizen, she also worries about the complexities and costs associated with the citizenship application process. Despite these challenges, Akua is optimistic about her future in the United States and is actively engaged in her community, volunteering at local cultural events that celebrate African and Latin American heritage.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- Ethnicity: Although the metadata does not specify Akua's ethnicity, it is assumed that she identifies with the Akan ethnic group, given her Ghanaian background and the surname \"Owusu,\" which is common among the Akan people.\n- Household Type: Based on the household relationship and marital status, it is assumed that Akua lives in a family household with her spouse and children."
