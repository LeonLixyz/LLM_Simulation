  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 79-year-old White female, born and raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She lives with her 102-year-old mother in a cozy, single-family home in the historic district of downtown Cheyenne. Emily has never been married and has dedicated her life to her family and career as a librarian.\n\nEmily holds a Master's degree in Library Science from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained in 1969. Her educational background and passion for literature have served her well in her 30-year career at the Laramie County Library, where she worked until her retirement in 2001.\n\nAs a retiree, Emily's annual income is approximately $45,000, consisting of her pension from the library, social security benefits, and some investments she made during her working years. She is frugal with her finances, prioritizing saving and supporting her mother's care over discretionary spending.\n\nEmily's mother, who owns the family home, has dementia, and Emily is her primary caregiver. This responsibility has become a significant focus of Emily's life, and she is deeply concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the impact of potential policy changes on her ability to provide for her mother.\n\nEmily's living situation, with its associated expenses and responsibilities, significantly influences her economic concerns. She is particularly interested in policies affecting healthcare, social security, and housing for seniors, as well as those that impact her ability to care for her mother.\n\nIn terms of political views, Emily tends to be conservative on fiscal matters, advocating for reduced government spending and lower taxes. However, she is more liberal when it comes to social issues, such as access to healthcare and education. Her experiences as a caregiver have made her more empathetic to the needs of vulnerable populations, and she supports policies that address these concerns.\n\nEmily's daily life revolves around caring for her mother, volunteering at the local library, and participating in her church community. Her social connections are primarily through these activities, and she values the sense of purpose and fulfillment they bring to her life."
