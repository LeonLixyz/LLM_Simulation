  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 22-year-old white female who resides in a shared house in Laramie, Wyoming. She is a non-relative housemate to three others in a rented, three-bedroom, one-bathroom house near the University of Wyoming campus. Emily is a US-born citizen from Illinois but has lived in Wyoming for the past four years. She speaks English fluently, having been born and raised in the United States.\n\nEmily has a high school diploma from her hometown in Illinois and attended two years of community college in Laramie, focusing on general studies. However, she did not complete her associate's degree due to financial constraints and a change in her career aspirations. She currently works part-time as a barista at a local coffee shop, making $18,500 per year, or about $1,542 per month.\n\nEmily's parents divorced when she was in high school, and she has one younger brother. She maintains a close relationship with her mother, who still resides in Illinois, and occasionally visits her during summer breaks or holidays. Emily's father, who remarried shortly after the divorce, lives in Colorado and has limited involvement in her life.\n\nEmily's primary economic concerns revolve around affording living expenses, saving for further education, and paying off her existing student loans. As a resident of Wyoming, she benefits from lower state taxes but faces challenges related to limited job opportunities and lower wages in the state. She relies on the Affordable Care Act for health insurance, as her part-time job does not offer benefits.\n\nGiven her experiences and concerns, Emily is likely to prioritize affordable education, healthcare, and economic development in her community when considering political issues."
