  "PERSONA": "Meet 29-year-old Maya Ramos, a Filipino-American woman living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her husband, Alex, who works as a mechanical engineer in the local oil industry. Maya is a part-time office assistant at a small law firm in downtown Cheyenne, earning $32,000 per year. She has been working at this job for about 3 years, having started shortly after moving to Wyoming from her hometown in California.\n\nMaya attended the University of Wyoming for two years before deciding to focus on her career, given the rising costs of tuition and her desire to gain practical work experience. Her decision to leave college without a degree has left her with some student loan debt, which she is diligently paying off.\n\nMaya and Alex rent a cozy two-bedroom apartment in a relatively new complex near the city center. Their rent is $1,100 per month, which is manageable given their combined income. However, they hope to save enough for a down payment on a house within the next few years.\n\nAs a spouse of the household, Maya takes care of most of the household chores and cooking. She enjoys trying out new Filipino recipes and experimenting with local ingredients. The couple does not have any children yet, but they are planning to start a family soon.\n\nMaya's economic concerns include paying off her student loans, saving for a house, and building a stable financial future for her family. She is also concerned about the impact of the oil industry's fluctuations on her husband's job security and the local economy. As a result, she is interested in policies that support small businesses, education, and job training programs.\n\nIn her free time, Maya volunteers at a local community center that provides language classes for immigrants. She also enjoys hiking in the nearby mountains and exploring the city's cultural events. Maya is fluent in English and has a strong sense of community, which motivates her to stay informed about local and national politics."
