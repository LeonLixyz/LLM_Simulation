  "PERSONA": "Meet 29-year-old Maria Elena Hernandez, a married Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides with her parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, which they own. Although the household structure isn't specified, it's assumed that Maria's parents are the primary owners, given her living situation. \n\nMaria holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, which she obtained from the University of Wyoming. She is fluent in English, having spoken it well since childhood, and does not speak Spanish at home. Her educational background has led her to secure a job as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company, earning an annual salary of $45,000.\n\nMaria is married to her high school sweetheart, Juan, who works as a mechanic at a nearby auto repair shop. They met in their senior year and married soon after Maria graduated from college. Juan's income is around $50,000 per year, which, combined with Maria's, brings their household income to $95,000. Although they're married, they're still living with Maria's parents due to the high cost of housing in Cheyenne and their desire to save for a down payment on their own home.\n\nMaria's primary economic concerns revolve around saving for a house, paying off student loans (she has $20,000 in outstanding debt), and planning for her future family. She and Juan are considering starting a family soon, which is also influencing their desire to move into their own home. Maria's parents, who are both retired, provide support and childcare for the couple, allowing them to save more efficiently.\n\nIn her free time, Maria volunteers at a local community center that helps low-income families access affordable healthcare and education resources. This experience has deepened her understanding of the economic challenges faced by many in her community and has sparked her interest in local politics, particularly policies related to affordable housing, education, and healthcare."
