  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old White female, is the primary householder of a married-couple household with two children, living in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a high school graduate who has leveraged her strong foundation in sciences to build a successful career as a medical laboratory technologist at Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, where she has worked for the past decade.\n\nAlex is married to her high school sweetheart, Michael, 40, who works as a financial analyst for a local bank. They have two children: Emily, 10, and Jack, 7, who attend the local public school system. The family resides in a 2,500-square-foot, two-story home in the suburb of Fox Farm, which they purchased in 2015 for $420,000. Their current mortgage is $2,800 per month, with an additional $800 in property taxes.\n\nAlex's annual salary is $220,000, placing her in the upper-middle-class bracket. Her income, combined with her husband's $120,000 salary, affords them a comfortable lifestyle, allowing for some savings, investments, and occasional family vacations. They also have a 2018 Honda Odyssey for family trips and a 2020 Toyota Tacoma for Michael's daily commute.\n\nAlex's health insurance is provided by her employer, with Michael and the children covered under his plan. She values her job's stability and the benefits it provides, which include a 401(k) plan with a 5% employer match, contributing 10% of her salary towards retirement savings.\n\nAs a working mother, Alex's economic concerns are centered around education and healthcare costs for her children, as well as ensuring she and her husband are adequately prepared for retirement. She is keenly interested in local and national policies affecting public education funding, healthcare reform, and tax policies that impact her family's financial stability.\n\nIn her free time, Alex volunteers at the local YMCA, teaching a weekly aerobics class, and is involved in the Parent-Teacher Association at her children's school. Her family enjoys outdoor activities, often visiting the nearby Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests for hiking and camping trips."
