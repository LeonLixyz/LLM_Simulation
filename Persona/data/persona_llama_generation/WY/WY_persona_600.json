  "PERSONA": "Meet 87-year-old Richard \"Dick\" Thompson, a high school graduate and lifelong English speaker, born in the United States, specifically in the state of Nebraska, but has resided in Wyoming for the past 40 years. As a non-veteran, Dick's career spanned various roles, culminating in a 25-year tenure as a mail carrier for the US Postal Service, from which he retired 17 years ago with a modest pension.\n\nDick has never married but has been in a long-term, committed relationship with his partner, 82-year-old James, for over 30 years. They share a cozy, single-story home in a quiet neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital and most populous city. The house, which they purchased in 2002 for $120,000, is now valued at around $250,000, providing them with a sense of financial security.\n\nAs a retiree, Dick's income primarily consists of his pension ($2,500 monthly), supplemented by Social Security benefits ($1,800 monthly), and occasional earnings from part-time gardening work for neighbors and friends ($500 monthly). This combined income of approximately $55,800 per year allows them to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, albeit with careful budgeting.\n\nDick's educational background, limited to a high school diploma, has not hindered his practical knowledge and skills, particularly in gardening and DIY home repairs, which he finds fulfilling and cost-effective. His English proficiency is excellent, reflecting his lifelong use of the language.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Dick is acutely aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy sector and tourism. He is concerned about the environmental impact of these industries and supports policies promoting sustainable practices. His economic priorities include protecting Social Security, affordable healthcare, and preserving the natural beauty of Wyoming for future generations.\n\nDick's advanced age and health considerations (he has manageable diabetes and uses a cane for mobility) make healthcare access and affordability significant concerns for him. He closely follows local and national discussions on these issues, often discussing them with James and their friends over dinner gatherings.\n\nIn the evenings, Dick enjoys listening to classic country music, reading about local history, and watching documentaries on wildlife conservation. Despite his physical limitations, Dick remains engaged with his community through volunteer work at a local community garden and occasional participation in city council meetings, where he advocates for senior-friendly policies and environmental stewardship."
