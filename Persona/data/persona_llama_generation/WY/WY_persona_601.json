  "PERSONA": "John \"Jack\" Thompson, a 68-year-old White male, resides in a small, single-family home he owns in the rural outskirts of Cheyenne, Wyoming. As a veteran who served in the US Army for six years, Jack's experience has significantly influenced his perspective on life and economic policies. Having never married, Jack lives alone, which simplifies his financial responsibilities but also presents unique challenges in terms of social support and future care.\n\nJack's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied automotive repair and maintenance. Although he did not complete a degree, his technical skills have been invaluable in his career as a self-employed mechanic, operating a small, home-based garage for over 30 years. This business venture has allowed him to be his own boss and maintain a flexible schedule, accommodating his preferences as he ages.\n\nJack's annual income is approximately $45,000, a combination of his business earnings and a modest military pension. He has managed to save for retirement through a combination of a small 401(k) and smart investments in the stock market. Despite this, Jack remains concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the impact of inflation on his fixed income, particularly as he grows older and requires more medical services.\n\nAs a homeowner, Jack benefits from the stability and sense of accomplishment that comes with owning property, but he also faces the challenges of maintenance and property taxes on a fixed income. His home, valued at $220,000, is his most significant asset, and he is careful to budget for repairs and upkeep to preserve its value.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Jack is keenly aware of the state's reliance on the energy industry and its cyclical nature. He supports policies that promote economic diversification and sustainable development, recognizing the need for Wyoming to adapt to changing economic conditions. His experiences as a veteran and small business owner also make him a strong advocate for policies that support entrepreneurship and provide adequate resources for veterans' healthcare and employment services.\n\nIn terms of transportation, Jack owns a 2015 Ford F-150, which he maintains himself, reflecting his DIY ethos and resourcefulness. This vehicle is essential for his daily needs, including running his business and accessing services in Cheyenne, which is about a 20-minute drive from his rural home.\n\nJack's leisure activities include outdoor pursuits such as hunting and fishing, which are readily accessible in Wyoming's vast natural landscapes. These activities not only provide him with a connection to nature but also serve as a way to manage stress and maintain physical activity as he ages.\n\nIn summary, Jack Thompson is a resilient, resourceful individual who has built a fulfilling life through his military service, entrepreneurship, and connection to his community. His experiences and concerns reflect a unique blend of rural Wyoming's challenges and opportunities, making him a valuable voice in discussions about economic and political policies affecting his state and the nation."
