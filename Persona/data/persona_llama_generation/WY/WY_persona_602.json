  "PERSONA": "Samantha Thompson, a 57-year-old white female, lives in a married-couple household without kids in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Although she is listed as divorced, she has been in a long-term, committed relationship with her partner, Mark, for the past 10 years. They chose not to formalize their union due to personal preferences and financial considerations. As the primary householder, Samantha takes care of the household expenses and financial decisions.\n\nSamantha is a high school graduate, having attended Cheyenne Central High School. After completing her education, she started working as a secretary in a local insurance firm. Over the years, she has gained significant experience in administrative roles and is currently employed as an office manager at a small business in Cheyenne, earning an annual income of $48,000.\n\nSamantha and Mark reside in a single-family home they purchased 12 years ago in a middle-class neighborhood. They have a mortgage of $120,000, with monthly payments of $900. Their household income is supplemented by Mark's earnings as a self-employed electrician, which averages around $60,000 per year.\n\nAs a US-born citizen, Samantha has always been interested in local politics and has voted in every election since she turned 18. Her primary economic concerns include affordable healthcare, education, and infrastructure development in her community. Samantha is fluent in English and speaks it well, having grown up in a monolingual household. Her birthplace is Wyoming, and she has lived in the state her entire life, taking pride in her local roots.\n\nGiven her experience as a high school graduate in a managerial role, Samantha values vocational training and education that prepares students for the workforce. She is concerned about the rising costs of higher education and its impact on young people's ability to find well-paying jobs. Her economic priorities include creating more job opportunities in Wyoming, particularly in industries that are less susceptible to economic downturns.\n\nSamantha's financial situation is relatively stable, but she is aware of the economic challenges faced by many in her community. She supports policies that promote local economic growth, improve access to affordable healthcare, and provide opportunities for skill development and education."
