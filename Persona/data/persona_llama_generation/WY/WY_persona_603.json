  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 49-year-old Mexican-American male living in Casper, Wyoming. As a non-relative housemate in a shared living arrangement, Juan resides in a moderate-sized house with three other individuals in a suburban neighborhood. Although the metadata does not specify household type, it is assumed that Juan lives in a rented property due to the non-relative housemate status.\n\nJuan holds a bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he completed after moving to the state from his birthplace in New Mexico. He works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm, with a specific job title of Sustainability Specialist. His annual income is $62,000, placing him in the middle class.\n\nAs a never-married individual, Juan's family structure is limited to his parents and an older sister, who reside in New Mexico. He has no dependents and enjoys a moderate level of financial independence, which allows him to travel occasionally and pursue outdoor activities like hiking and camping.\n\nJuan is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently, having learned it as his primary language from a young age. His proficiency in English has facilitated his career advancement and daily interactions in Wyoming, where he has built a social network of colleagues and acquaintances.\n\nGiven his background in environmental science and experience as a Sustainability Specialist, Juan's economic concerns revolve around environmental issues, such as climate change, conservation, and sustainable resource management. He is likely to support policies that promote eco-friendly practices, renewable energy, and responsible land use. Additionally, as a renter, Juan may be interested in affordable housing initiatives and tenant protection laws.\n\nIn terms of geographic implications, living in Wyoming, a state with a strong energy industry, Juan may have mixed views on policies related to fossil fuel extraction and renewable energy development. His location in Casper, a city with a relatively low cost of living, also influences his economic priorities, as he may be more concerned with job security and career growth than with high-cost urban issues like gentrification."
