  "PERSONA": "Meet 22-year-old Daniela Morales, a Mexican-American female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides with her parents, Jorge and Maria, in a two-story, three-bedroom house in the downtown area, within walking distance to the local community college. Daniela is a high school graduate, having completed her diploma from Cheyenne Central High School. She is currently taking a gap year to work and save money for college, aspiring to pursue a degree in business administration.\n\nDaniela works part-time as a sales associate at a local boutique, earning $12.50 per hour, working approximately 25 hours a week. Her parents, Jorge and Maria, own a small Mexican restaurant in the city, where Daniela occasionally helps with waitressing on weekends. Her father, Jorge, is a naturalized US citizen, having immigrated to the United States in his early twenties, while her mother, Maria, was born in the US to Mexican immigrant parents.\n\nAs the youngest of three siblings, Daniela's family is close-knit. Her older brother, Carlos, is a senior at the University of Wyoming, studying engineering, and her sister, Elena, is a freshman at Laramie County Community College, pursuing a degree in nursing. Daniela's family income is around $60,000 per year, with her parents' restaurant generating the majority of the income.\n\nGrowing up in Cheyenne, Daniela has been exposed to a mix of urban and rural influences. She is fluent in English and has a deep appreciation for her Mexican heritage, often participating in local cultural events and celebrations. Daniela's economic concerns include saving for college, helping her family with expenses, and eventually becoming financially independent. She is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to education, small business development, and community growth.\n\nDaniela's living situation, family background, and career aspirations shape her economic and political views. As a young, Hispanic woman in a predominantly rural state, her experiences and priorities may differ from those of her urban counterparts, making her a unique voice in policy discussions."
