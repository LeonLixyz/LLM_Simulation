  "PERSONA": "Meet Agnes Thompson, a 79-year-old white female living in a small, single-family home in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She has never been married and has no children, making her a single household unit. Agnes was born in Wyoming and has lived there her entire life, which is reflected in her strong sense of community and conservative values. She speaks only English and does so fluently.\n\nAgnes did not complete high school, having left in the 10th grade to work and support her family. This decision, although necessary at the time, has had a lasting impact on her career trajectory. She worked primarily in the retail sector, spending over 20 years as a sales associate at a local department store before retiring at the age of 65. Her income from Social Security and a small pension is approximately $25,000 per year.\n\nAs the primary householder, Agnes owns her home, which she inherited from her parents. The house is modest, with two bedrooms and one bathroom, situated in a quiet neighborhood near the city center. Her monthly mortgage payments are minimal, as the house is nearly paid off, but she does struggle with property taxes and maintenance costs on a fixed income.\n\nAgnes's economic concerns are centered around healthcare and the rising costs of living. She relies on Medicare for her health insurance but is worried about potential changes to the program that could affect her coverage. She also worries about the increasing cost of groceries and utilities, which seem to eat into her budget more each year.\n\nDespite these challenges, Agnes remains active in her community, volunteering at a local food bank and participating in neighborhood watch programs. Her conservative upbringing and limited exposure to diverse viewpoints have shaped her political views, which tend to align with traditional Republican values. However, her personal experiences with the challenges of living on a fixed income have also made her more sympathetic to policies supporting seniors and the economically vulnerable.\n\nAgnes's daily life is simple, with most of her time spent tending to her garden, reading, and watching television. She values her independence and is proud of her ability to live on her own, despite the challenges that come with aging."
