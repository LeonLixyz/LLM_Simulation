  "PERSONA": "Meet 28-year-old Ryder Morales, a single, US-born male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ryder identifies as being of mixed Latin American descent, specifically having a Chilean mother and a Puerto Rican father, categorizing him as \"Some Other Race.\" He resides with his parents in a two-story, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, where he grew up. \n\nRyder's parents, both high school sweethearts, own the home, which they purchased in 1995. His father works as a mechanic at a local garage, while his mother is a part-time librarian at the local library. Ryder's living situation allows him to contribute to household expenses, but he doesn't pay rent.\n\nRyder attended Cheyenne's East High School and later enrolled in a two-year program at Laramie County Community College, where he studied automotive technology. However, he dropped out after one year due to financial constraints and a lack of interest in pursuing a degree. Ryder currently works as a service advisor at a local car dealership, earning around $38,000 per year. \n\nRyder is fluent in English, having spoken it as his primary language since birth. He has never been married and doesn't have any dependents. As a non-veteran, Ryder hasn't received any military training or benefits. \n\nRyder's primary economic concerns include saving for a down payment on his own home, paying off his outstanding student loans (around $5,000), and building an emergency fund. He prioritizes financial stability and security, which motivates his views on economic policies, particularly those related to education, housing, and employment opportunities."
