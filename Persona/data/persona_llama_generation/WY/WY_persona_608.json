  "PERSONA": "Meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old widow and primary householder living in Casper, Wyoming. She is a high school graduate, having attended Natrona County High School in Casper, where she grew up after moving from her birth state of Montana at a young age. Alex is a U.S. citizen, born and raised in the United States, and speaks English fluently.\n\nAs a single mother, Alex is the sole caregiver for her two children, Emily (10) and Jackson (7). They reside in a modest, single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood near downtown Casper, which Alex inherited from her late husband. The house, valued at around $220,000, has a mortgage of $180,000, with monthly payments of $1,200. Alex also pays around $1,500 per month for childcare, as both children attend a local elementary school.\n\nAlex works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local medical clinic, earning a gross income of $32,000 per year. Her late husband, a former oil rig worker, passed away in an accident three years ago, leaving her with a modest life insurance payout that she uses to supplement her income and cover unexpected expenses. She also receives a monthly widow's benefit of $1,800 from Social Security.\n\nDespite her financial challenges, Alex is proud of her independence and resourcefulness. She is an avid supporter of local businesses and community initiatives, often volunteering at her children's school and participating in neighborhood events. Her economic concerns include affording healthcare for her family, saving for her children's education, and maintaining her home's value in a fluctuating local market.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, Alex values job security, affordable healthcare, and accessible education. She is likely to support policies that promote small businesses, improve access to healthcare, and increase funding for public education. Her experience as a widow and single mother has also made her sensitive to the needs of vulnerable populations, leading her to advocate for social welfare programs and community support services."
