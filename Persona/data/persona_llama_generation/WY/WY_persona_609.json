  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson is a 79-year-old white male living in a single-family home in the outskirts of Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder, he resides alone in a modest, two-bedroom house he has owned since 2001, with a mortgage that is nearly paid off. Harold has never married and does not have any children.\n\nHarold was born in Denver, Colorado, but moved to Wyoming in his late 20s for work. He completed two years at Casper College, studying mechanical engineering but did not graduate due to financial constraints. This educational background led him to a career in the energy sector, where he worked as a maintenance technician for a natural gas company until his retirement at 65.\n\nHis annual retirement income is approximately $43,000, consisting of a pension from his job and Social Security benefits. Harold's economic concerns include rising healthcare costs, particularly for his diabetes medication, and the increasing property taxes on his home. Despite these concerns, he values his independence and is wary of government programs that might compromise it.\n\nHarold speaks English fluently and has no known ethnic affiliations. He is a non-veteran and has no immediate family members living with him. His daily routine includes volunteering at a local animal shelter and participating in community events in Casper, where he is well-known for his mechanical skills and willingness to lend a hand.\n\nGiven his economic situation and living arrangement, Harold's political views tend to lean conservative, with a focus on limited government intervention in personal and economic matters. However, his experience with the healthcare system has made him more open to discussions about healthcare reform and the importance of affordable access to medical care for seniors."
