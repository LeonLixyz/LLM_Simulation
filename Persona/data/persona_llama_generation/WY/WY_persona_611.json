  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old White female, living in a family household with her parents in Casper, Wyoming. She is married to her husband, Ryan, whom she met in high school, but they are currently separated and living apart due to Ryan's job in the oil industry, which frequently takes him out of state. Alex's parents, both in their early sixties, own the single-family home they all reside in, a modest three-bedroom house in a middle-class neighborhood near downtown Casper.\n\nAlex graduated from Natrona County High School in 2004 and briefly attended Casper College but did not pursue a degree. She works as a part-time receptionist at a local dentist's office, earning $28,000 per year. Her husband, Ryan, works as a rig worker, earning around $60,000 annually, but his income is irregular due to the fluctuating demands of the oil industry.\n\nAlex's primary language is English, which she speaks fluently, and she was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, but has lived in Casper for most of her life. She is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. Alex's economic concerns revolve around financial stability, as her husband's irregular income and their current separation have caused stress on their household budget. She prioritizes affordable healthcare, education, and job security, hoping for a more stable future for herself and her family."
