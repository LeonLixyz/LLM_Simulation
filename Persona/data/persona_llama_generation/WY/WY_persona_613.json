  "PERSONA": "Meet 57-year-old James Wilson, a high school graduate living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with his wife. As the spouse of the household, James's wife is the primary breadwinner, working as an accountant in a local firm, earning around $65,000 annually. James works part-time as a sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, supplementing the household income with approximately $25,000 per year. They own a modest single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, valued at around $280,000, with a mortgage of $1,500 per month. \n\nJames's educational background, limited to a high school diploma, has influenced his career trajectory, leading him to take on roles that do not require a college degree. He has been working in retail for over a decade, having previously managed a small sporting goods store before it closed down. His current part-time job allows him to pursue his passion for the outdoors while supporting his family.\n\nJames and his wife have two adult children who have moved out of the house, one working as a nurse in Denver, Colorado, and the other attending college in Laramie, Wyoming. This has reduced their household expenses, but they still worry about saving for retirement, as they are both nearing 60. James's primary economic concerns revolve around ensuring a stable financial future, especially with the rising costs of healthcare and the uncertainty of social security benefits.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, James is keenly aware of the state's reliance on the energy industry and the economic fluctuations that come with it. He supports local businesses and is involved in his community, often participating in town hall meetings to voice his opinions on economic development and environmental policies. James is a proud US citizen, born and raised in Wyoming, and values the independence and self-reliance that comes with living in a rural state."
