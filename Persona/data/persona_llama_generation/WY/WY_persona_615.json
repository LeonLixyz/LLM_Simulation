  "PERSONA": "Meet John Thompson, a 62-year-old white male living in the state of Wyoming. He is the spouse of the household and has been divorced for about 5 years. John was born in the state of Oregon but moved to Wyoming 20 years ago for a job opportunity. He is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently.\n\nJohn's educational background includes some college education, having attended Casper College in Wyoming for two years, where he studied business administration but did not obtain a degree. This educational foundation has been beneficial in his career as an administrative assistant in the local government sector, a position he has held for the past 10 years. His annual income is approximately $45,000.\n\nJohn and his current spouse reside in a two-bedroom house they own in the suburbs of Casper, the second-largest city in Wyoming. Their home, valued at around $280,000, is a significant asset for them, and they are proud of their accomplishment in becoming homeowners about 15 years ago. John's spouse works as a school teacher, and together they have a combined household income of around $90,000.\n\nJohn's family structure is complex; he has two adult children from his previous marriage, both of whom live in different parts of the country. His son works in the tech industry in California, and his daughter is a nurse in New York. Despite the distance, John maintains a close relationship with his children, who visit him and his spouse during holidays.\n\nGiven his age and economic situation, John's primary economic concerns include retirement savings and healthcare costs. He is keenly interested in policies that address the affordability of healthcare and the stability of social security. John's experience living in a relatively rural state has also made him aware of the importance of infrastructure development and access to quality education in less populated areas.\n\nJohn's voting history and political views are influenced by his background as a government employee and his concerns as a homeowner and future retiree. He tends to lean towards moderate policies that balance economic growth with social welfare, particularly in areas affecting his personal life, such as healthcare and retirement security."
