  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male living in the city of Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Ethan is married but currently separated from his wife, Sarah. They met in high school and got married at 25 but have been living apart for the past two years due to work-related issues. Ethan's wife works as a nurse in a nearby town, and they maintain a long-distance relationship.\n\nEthan is a high school graduate and did not pursue higher education. However, he has completed several vocational training courses and certifications in diesel mechanics. He works as a diesel mechanic at a local truck repair shop, earning an annual income of $55,000. Ethan's job is physically demanding but provides him with a sense of satisfaction and stability.\n\nEthan rents a two-bedroom apartment in a modest neighborhood in Cheyenne for $900 per month. He does not own a home due to financial constraints and the uncertainty of his marital situation. Despite this, he is proud of his independence and takes care of his apartment, which is decorated with memories from his outdoor adventures.\n\nAs a native English speaker born in the United States, Ethan has never faced language barriers. He was born in the state of Montana but moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age. Ethan's parents were both blue-collar workers who valued hard work and self-reliance, which has shaped his views on economic policy.\n\nEthan's economic concerns revolve around job security, affordable healthcare, and the rising cost of living in Wyoming. As someone who works in a male-dominated industry, he is also concerned about workers' rights and fair compensation. In his free time, Ethan enjoys hiking and fishing in the nearby mountains. He is an avid supporter of conservation efforts and believes in responsible land use.\n\nAssumptions made:\n\n- Based on the \"Different state\" birth detail, it was assumed that Ethan was born in Montana, given its proximity to Wyoming.\n- Ethan's wife's job and location were assumed to be in a nearby town to justify their long-distance relationship.\n- The specific neighborhood type and apartment details were chosen to reflect Ethan's modest economic situation.\n- Ethan's interests and hobbies were selected based on Wyoming's outdoor recreational opportunities and his blue-collar background."
