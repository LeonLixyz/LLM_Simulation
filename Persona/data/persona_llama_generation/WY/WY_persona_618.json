  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old White female, is the primary householder of her single-person household in Casper, Wyoming. Born in Illinois but having moved to Wyoming for college, Alex is a US citizen who speaks only English fluently. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in three years due to her academic excellence and transfer credits from a community college she attended before moving.\n\nAs a young widow, Alex's life took an unexpected turn when her husband, a coal miner, passed away in an accident just a year into their marriage. This significant life event has shaped her economic concerns and priorities, particularly regarding workers' rights, healthcare, and social security benefits for the bereaved. She currently works as an Environmental Consultant for a small firm in Casper, earning a modest income of $48,000 per year. Her job involves assessing the environmental impact of various projects in the region, utilizing her knowledge of local ecosystems.\n\nAlex rents a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the historic downtown area of Casper for $800 per month, which is relatively affordable given her income. She values the proximity to her workplace and the vibrant community life in the neighborhood. Despite the challenges she faces as a young widow, Alex is determined to continue her education, planning to pursue a Master's degree in Sustainable Development in the near future. This ambition is driven by her desire to contribute more significantly to environmental policy-making in Wyoming and to secure a better financial future for herself.\n\nGiven her circumstances, Alex's economic concerns are centered around affordable healthcare, education costs, and employment opportunities in her field. Politically, she leans towards policies that support environmental protection, workers' rights, and social welfare programs, especially those aimed at supporting young widows and widowers."
