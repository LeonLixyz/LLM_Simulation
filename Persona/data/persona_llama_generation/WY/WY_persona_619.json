  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 28-year-old white female, is the primary householder in a married-couple household without children, residing in a cozy, two-bedroom apartment in the downtown area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She was born in Casper, Wyoming, and has spent most of her life in the state.\n\nAlex is a high school graduate, having attended Kelly Walsh High School in Casper, where she was an average student with a keen interest in business and economics. After high school, she decided not to pursue higher education immediately, opting instead to gain work experience and save money. She started working as a part-time bank teller at a local bank in Casper and, over the years, moved up the ranks to become a full-time customer service representative.\n\nIn 2019, Alex met her husband, Ryan, a 30-year-old software engineer, while attending a friend's wedding in Cheyenne. They got married in 2021 and decided to settle in Cheyenne for its economic opportunities and Ryan's job. Alex currently works as a customer service manager at a mid-sized bank in Cheyenne, earning an annual salary of $55,000. Ryan works as a senior software engineer at a tech firm, earning around $90,000 per year.\n\nTheir combined income allows them to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle, with some savings for the future. They pay $1,200 per month in rent for their apartment and are considering buying a house in the suburbs within the next two years. They do not have any children yet, but plan to start a family in the near future.\n\nAlex's economic concerns revolve around saving for a down payment on a house, paying off her student loans (she has around $15,000 in debt from a short stint at a community college), and building an emergency fund. She is also interested in retirement savings, as her bank offers a 401(k) matching program.\n\nPolitically, Alex is moderately conservative, influenced by her upbringing in a rural state and her work in the banking sector. She values financial stability and security, which shapes her views on economic policies. However, she is also open to progressive ideas, particularly those related to education and healthcare, as she believes that a strong social safety net is essential for the well-being of the community.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking, reading, and volunteering at local animal shelters. She is an avid follower of local news and participates in online forums discussing state politics and economic development in Wyoming."
