  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 37-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his long-time partner, Emily, whom he met while pursuing his Associate's degree in Business Administration from Laramie County Community College. Despite being married, Ryan's marital status is listed as \"Never married\" due to their decision to have a non-traditional, non-legally recognized union.\n\nRyan works as an administrative assistant at a local insurance firm, where he has been employed for five years. His annual income is $19,500, which is supplemented by his wife's income as a freelance graphic designer. They share a modest, two-bedroom apartment in a downtown neighborhood, paying $900 per month in rent. They do not own a home, opting to allocate their savings towards traveling and paying off student loans.\n\nRyan's family consists of his spouse, Emily, and their two cats, Max and Luna. He is close to his family, particularly his younger sister who lives in their hometown of Casper, Wyoming. Ryan and Emily are considering starting a family, but their current financial situation and career goals have them postponing this decision.\n\nAs a native Wyomingite, Ryan is proud of his state's natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities. He spends his free time hiking, fishing, and attending local events. Ryan's economic concerns include affordable healthcare, access to quality education, and preserving Wyoming's natural resources. He is also interested in policies that support small businesses and entrepreneurship, as his wife's freelance work has given him insight into the challenges faced by independent workers.\n\nRyan's educational background has served him well in his administrative role, but he sometimes feels underemployed given his degree. He is considering furthering his education to move into a management position or start his own business. For now, he is focused on building a stable financial foundation for his family's future.\n\nRyan's language proficiency is excellent, and he only speaks English. He has never served in the military and does not have any immediate family members who have served. Ryan's private health insurance is provided through his employer, which has been a significant factor in his job security and overall well-being."
