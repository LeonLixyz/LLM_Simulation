  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 49-year-old single woman living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a non-Hispanic white female, born in Billings, Montana, but has resided in Wyoming for over two decades. Alex is a high school graduate with a diploma from Cheyenne East High School and has not pursued any higher education due to financial constraints and a desire to enter the workforce early.\n\nAs the primary householder, Alex rents a modest, one-bedroom apartment in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne, paying $800 per month. Her annual income is $42,000, which she earns as a sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, where she has worked for the past eight years. She enjoys the job due to her passion for hiking and camping in Wyoming's vast wilderness areas.\n\nAlex has never been married and does not have children, which has allowed her to focus on her career and personal interests. She values her independence and freedom, often spending her free time exploring Wyoming's natural beauty or practicing yoga at a local studio.\n\nDespite being a non-veteran, Alex's father was a veteran, and she has a deep respect for those who serve in the military. She is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently, having grown up in an English-speaking household.\n\nAlex's economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly the increasing rent prices, and the need for better job opportunities in the area that would allow her to advance her career and increase her income. She is also concerned about access to affordable healthcare and the impact of climate change on Wyoming's environment and economy."
