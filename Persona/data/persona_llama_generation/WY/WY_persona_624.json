  "PERSONA": "Alex Thompson, a 38-year-old white male, is married but currently living with his parents in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming. He was born in Arizona but has lived in Wyoming for over five years. Alex is a high school graduate and has not pursued higher education due to financial constraints. His English proficiency is excellent, as it is his native language.\n\nAlex works as a sales representative in the automotive sector, with a yearly income of $45,000. His job involves interacting with customers, understanding their needs, and providing them with suitable vehicle options. He has been in this role for three years and has developed strong communication skills.\n\nDespite being married, Alex's living situation is influenced by financial challenges. His wife, Sarah, is a part-time nurse, and they have a 2-year-old daughter. Due to the high cost of childcare and their mortgage payments on a modest home they own, they made the decision for Alex to move in with his parents temporarily to reduce expenses and save money.\n\nAlex's family responsibilities are significant, with his primary concerns being providing for his family and ensuring his daughter receives a good education. His economic priorities include saving for his daughter's future, paying off their mortgage, and building a stable financial foundation.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Alex is aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy sector and tourism. He supports policies that promote job growth and economic diversification, hoping for more opportunities in emerging industries. His experience living in a different state and now in Wyoming has also made him appreciate the importance of regional development and the challenges faced by rural communities.\n\nAlex's economic concerns are centered around the affordability of healthcare, education, and the cost of living. He believes in the importance of accessible and affordable healthcare, especially with a young child, and supports policies that aim to make healthcare more affordable for families. He also advocates for better funding for public schools to ensure his daughter receives a quality education."
