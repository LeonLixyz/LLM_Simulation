  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old divorced woman, lives in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital. She is of White race, was born in Wyoming, and is a US citizen. Alex is fluent in English, having spoken it her entire life. After high school, she pursued higher education, obtaining an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Laramie County Community College. \n\nAssuming a typical career trajectory for someone with her educational background, Alex works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance firm, earning approximately $38,000 annually. Given her income and marital status, she likely shares a moderate-sized, two-bedroom apartment with her 10-year-old son, for which she pays around $900 per month in rent. This arrangement allows her to balance childcare responsibilities with her part-time job, as her son's father contributes to their child's upbringing through regular alimony payments.\n\nAs a single mother in a relatively small city, Alex's economic concerns revolve around affordable healthcare, quality education for her son, and job security. She values policies supporting working-class families, such as tax credits for childcare and increased funding for public schools. Alex's experience as a single mother has made her particularly sensitive to economic instability and the challenges faced by low-to-middle-income households in rural states like Wyoming."
