  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 29-year-old White male living with his parents in a single-family home in the suburbs of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ethan is a non-veteran, born in the United States but in a different state, specifically Oregon, and has been a US citizen since birth. He speaks only English and is proficient in it. \n\nEthan's educational background includes completing two years of community college, where he studied business administration but did not obtain a degree. He currently works as a sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, earning approximately $32,000 annually. His job involves helping customers choose equipment for activities such as hiking and camping, which are popular in Wyoming.\n\nEthan has never been married and does not have any dependents. Living with his parents helps him save money, as he pays a minimal amount for rent and utilities. His parents own their home, which they have lived in for over 20 years. Ethan's father works as an engineer, and his mother is a part-time teacher.\n\nGiven his situation, Ethan's primary economic concerns include saving enough to eventually move out and own his home, as well as advancing in his career to increase his income. He is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to environmental conservation and outdoor recreation, which directly affect his work and personal interests."
