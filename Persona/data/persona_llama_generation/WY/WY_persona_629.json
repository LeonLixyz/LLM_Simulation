  "PERSONA": "Meet Deborah Jenkins, a 62-year-old White female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is a widowed woman who has been the primary householder of her residence since her husband's passing five years ago. Deborah was born in Montana but has lived in Wyoming for over three decades, having moved there with her late husband for his job in the energy sector.\n\nDeborah's educational background includes two years of college, where she studied business administration. Although she did not complete her degree, her education has been instrumental in her career as an administrative assistant in a local law firm. She has been with the firm for over 15 years and earns an annual salary of $48,000.\n\nDeborah owns her home, a modest three-bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Casper. Her mortgage is paid off, which is a significant relief, but she still has to manage monthly utility bills, property taxes, and maintenance costs. She has a small garden where she grows some of her vegetables and fruits, which helps in reducing her grocery bills.\n\nAs a widow living alone, Deborah's economic concerns revolve around ensuring she has enough savings for retirement and managing her expenses on a fixed income. She is concerned about potential changes to social security benefits and healthcare costs, as she relies on Medicare for her health insurance. Deborah is also worried about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing property taxes and utility bills.\n\nDeborah's late husband was a union member, and she has seen firsthand the benefits of collective bargaining. As a result, she is a strong supporter of workers' rights and often votes for candidates who prioritize labor unions and workers' welfare. Deborah is also passionate about environmental issues, particularly those affecting her home state, such as coal mining and fracking regulations.\n\nIn her free time, Deborah enjoys volunteering at the local animal shelter, gardening, and reading. She values her independence and is proud of her ability to manage her household and finances on her own. Despite the challenges she faces as a widow, Deborah remains optimistic about her future and is determined to make the most of her retirement years."
