  "PERSONA": "Meet 57-year-old Nadia Thompson, a Black or African American woman living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state's capital and largest city. She resides with her parents in a single-family home in a mixed-income neighborhood near the downtown area. Nadia is married but currently separated from her husband, who works in the nearby oil fields. She has no children of her own, but often helps care for her younger nieces and nephews who live nearby.\n\nNadia was born and raised in Cheyenne, graduating from Cheyenne East High School. She did not pursue higher education due to family financial constraints and entered the workforce directly. She previously worked as a part-time administrative assistant at a local non-profit organization but is currently not in the labor force due to a combination of caregiving responsibilities for her aging parents and a lack of job opportunities in her field.\n\nAssuming her husband's income is the primary source of household income, Nadia estimates their combined annual household income falls around $42,000. However, they struggle to make ends meet, especially with her lack of personal income and the absence of health insurance coverage, forcing them to rely on community clinics for medical care.\n\nNadia's economic concerns center around accessing affordable healthcare, securing a stable job that accommodates her caregiving responsibilities, and navigating the rising costs of living in Cheyenne, which is experiencing rapid growth and development. She is also worried about the environmental impact of the oil and gas industry on the local community and the state's economy.\n\nPolitically, Nadia is likely to support policies that address income inequality, expand access to affordable healthcare, and promote sustainable economic growth that balances development with environmental protection. Her experiences as a caregiver and her concerns about healthcare access and economic stability make her particularly attuned to policy discussions around social welfare programs and job creation initiatives."
