  "PERSONA": "Austin James, a 29-year-old non-Hispanic White male, is the primary householder of his single-person household in Casper, Wyoming. He has never been married and does not have any children. Born in Billings, Montana, Austin moved to Wyoming for better job opportunities after dropping out of high school in the 9th grade. He has since acquired his GED and pursued vocational training in automotive repair.\n\nAustin works as a full-time diesel mechanic at a local truck repair shop, earning an annual salary of $43,000. He is fluent in English, having grown up speaking it as his primary language. Despite not being a veteran, Austin's family has a military background; his father served in the US Army.\n\nAustin rents a small, one-bedroom apartment in a working-class neighborhood near downtown Casper, paying $700 per month. He owns a 2015 Ford F-150, which he uses for both personal and work-related transportation. His primary economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off his $10,000 in student loan debt from his vocational training, and affording rising healthcare costs.\n\nAustin's limited education has presented some career advancement challenges, but he is determined to continue learning and expanding his skill set to increase his earning potential. He spends his free time reading automotive repair manuals and attending seminars to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies in his field.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Austin is particularly interested in policies affecting the energy and manufacturing sectors, which are significant contributors to the state's economy. He also closely follows issues related to affordable housing, education, and job training programs, which he believes are crucial for individuals like himself who did not complete high school."
