  "PERSONA": "Meet Jennifer Thompson, a 49-year-old White female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is divorced and resides with her new partner, who is the primary household earner. Jennifer is a veteran of the US Army, where she served for six years as a logistics coordinator, a skill set she later utilized in her civilian career.\n\nJennifer's educational background includes two years of study in business administration at Casper College, although she did not complete her degree due to financial constraints and the need to enter the workforce. This educational foundation, however, has been instrumental in her current role as a purchasing agent at a local manufacturing firm, where she earns an annual salary of $52,000.\n\nAs a divorced individual, Jennifer's previous marriage ended after seven years, and she has joint custody of her 12-year-old son, who splits his time between Jennifer's residence and that of her ex-husband in a nearby town. Her current partner, with whom she has been living for three years, is a high school teacher, and together they contribute to the household income, which totals around $90,000 annually.\n\nJennifer and her partner rent a three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, with a monthly rent of $1,200. They have been considering purchasing a home but are cautious due to the economic climate and their combined student loan debt of $30,000, which they are diligently working to pay off.\n\nGiven her background as a veteran and her current economic situation, Jennifer's primary economic concerns include affordable healthcare, particularly for veterans, and policies that support education and job training programs. She is also keenly interested in initiatives that address the rising costs of housing and student loan forgiveness programs. Politically, she tends to lean towards candidates who prioritize veterans' rights, education, and economic policies that benefit the middle class."
