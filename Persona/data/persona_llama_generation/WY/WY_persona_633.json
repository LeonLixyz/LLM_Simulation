  "PERSONA": "John \"Jack\" Thompson is a 69-year-old White male, residing in the town of Jackson, Wyoming, in a household with his partner, whom he has been with for over 15 years. They have chosen not to formalize their union through marriage, a decision reflective of their independent nature and commitment to each other outside of traditional marital structures.\n\nAssuming John's household type, given his marital status and household relationship, is that of an unmarried partner household, possibly with a domestic partner or a partner in a civil union, reflecting his personal choices and the evolving definitions of family in modern society.\n\nAs a non-veteran, John did not serve in the military, instead pursuing higher education, which culminated in a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming. This educational background has been instrumental in his career as an Environmental Consultant for the past 30 years, primarily working with local businesses and the state government on sustainable development projects. His job requires a deep understanding of Wyoming's unique environmental challenges and opportunities, a skillset he has honed through years of experience and further education.\n\nJohn and his partner own their home, a modest, eco-friendly house on the outskirts of Jackson, which they have modified over the years to be more sustainable, reflecting their shared passion for environmental conservation. Their decision to own a home in Wyoming was influenced by their love for the outdoors and the desire to live in a state with a strong sense of community and a slower pace of life.\n\nJohn's annual income from his consulting work is approximately $85,000, supplemented by his partner's income as a part-time teacher at the local high school. Together, they have a combined income of around $115,000, which allows them to live comfortably in Wyoming, where the cost of living is relatively high compared to other states.\n\nJohn's primary economic concerns include the impact of climate change on Wyoming's tourism industry, which is a significant contributor to the state's economy, and the need for sustainable economic development that balances environmental protection with job creation. His educational background and professional experience have instilled in him a strong belief in the importance of science-driven policy and the need for bipartisan cooperation to address environmental challenges.\n\nJohn is fluent in English, having been born and raised in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming, which has deeply rooted him in local culture and issues. Despite his professional success, John remains grounded, attributing his success to his upbringing in a small Wyoming town, which taught him the value of hard work and community.\n\nJohn's detailed background, from his educational achievements to his professional career, his personal choices, and his deep connection to Wyoming, positions him as a unique and informed voice within his community, with economic and political views shaped by his experiences and the environment he calls home."
