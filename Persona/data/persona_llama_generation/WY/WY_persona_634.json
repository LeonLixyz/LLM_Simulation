  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 39-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Maria, and they have two children, ages 7 and 9. Juan is the spouse of the household, with Maria being the primary breadwinner as a registered nurse at the local hospital. Juan works as a part-time electrician, earning $42,000 annually, which supplements Maria's income of $65,000. They own a modest three-bedroom home in a mixed-income neighborhood, valued at $220,000, with a mortgage of $1,500 per month.\n\nJuan was born in Wyoming, and his family has lived in the state for three generations. He attended Cheyenne Central High School and later enrolled in Laramie County Community College, where he studied electrical engineering for two years before dropping out to pursue a job opportunity. Despite not having a degree, Juan has built a successful career as an electrician, working for a local contractor and occasionally taking on side jobs to make ends meet.\n\nJuan and Maria are proud of their Mexican heritage and actively participate in the local Hispanic community.
