  "PERSONA": "A 28-year-old White male, born in the state of Wyoming, who is a non-veteran and speaks English fluently. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he completed at the age of 23. Following graduation, he secured a job as a Conservation Specialist at the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, earning an annual salary of $52,000. He works full-time, typically 40 hours a week, and occasionally travels across the state for work-related projects.\n\nHe is the primary householder in a married-couple household without kids, living with his partner of four years, whom he has not yet married due to personal preferences and career priorities. They reside in a rented, two-bedroom apartment in downtown Cheyenne, paying $1,200 per month in rent. The decision to rent rather than buy is largely due to the couple's desire for flexibility and the relatively low cost of renting compared to buying a home in their area.\n\nHis partner works part-time as a librarian at the local library, earning around $25,000 annually, supplementing their household income. Together, they have a combined household income of $77,000. They manage their finances carefully, allocating 30% of their income towards rent, utilities, and groceries, 20% towards savings, and the remaining 50% towards discretionary spending, debt repayment, and long-term investments.\n\nHe is concerned about the economic implications of environmental policies on local businesses and communities, given his role in conservation. His economic priorities include job security, affordable healthcare, and sustainable economic growth that aligns with environmental protection. He values education highly, attributing his career success to his university education, and supports policies that make higher education more accessible and affordable.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, he is aware of the state's reliance on the energy sector and the challenges posed by the transition to renewable energy. He believes in a balanced approach that supports both economic development and environmental sustainability. His views on political issues are shaped by his professional experience, educational background, and personal values, making him a moderate voter who weighs the economic and environmental impacts of policies before making decisions."
