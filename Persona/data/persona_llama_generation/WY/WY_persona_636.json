  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson is a 38-year-old male, identifying as White and of Native American descent through his mother's side. He lives in Casper, Wyoming, the second-largest city in the state, with his long-term partner, Alex, in a committed, unmarried relationship. Ethan has never been married, but he and Alex have been together for over 10 years. They reside in a rented two-bedroom condominium in the historic downtown area of Casper, paying $950 per month in rent.\n\nEthan holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he earned in 2008. This education background has been instrumental in his career as an Environmental Consultant for a private firm specializing in sustainable development and conservation projects in the western United States. His job involves frequent travel across the region, assessing environmental impact and proposing sustainable solutions for various development projects. Ethan's annual income is $73,000, which, combined with Alex's income as a freelance graphic designer, allows them to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nEthan's family structure is close-knit, with his immediate family residing in Wyoming. His mother, a retired schoolteacher, lives in Cheyenne, and his father, a rancher, still works on their family's land near Cody. Ethan and Alex often visit them on weekends and holidays, especially during the summer months when they can participate in outdoor activities like hiking and camping.\n\nEthan's primary economic concerns revolve around the sustainability of his job in the face of environmental policy changes and the fluctuating energy market. He is also concerned about healthcare costs, as he and Alex rely on private insurance, which can be expensive. Despite these concerns, Ethan feels fortunate to live in Wyoming, where the cost of living is relatively low, and the natural environment provides endless opportunities for outdoor activities.\n\nPolitically, Ethan leans towards policies that support environmental conservation and sustainable development. He believes in the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection and is active in local initiatives that promote green energy and wildlife conservation. Ethan's views on economic policies are influenced by his experiences working with communities affected by environmental degradation and his desire to see more investment in renewable energy sources."
