  "PERSONA": "John Michael Harris, a 57-year-old White male, resides in a multigenerational household in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as the younger brother of the household's primary resident. Born in Wyoming, John is a lifelong resident of the state and is a U.S. citizen by birth. He has never been married and does not have any children of his own, which has allowed him to maintain a relatively flexible lifestyle.\n\nJohn's educational background includes completing two years of coursework in mechanical engineering at a local community college but not obtaining a degree due to financial constraints and a change in career interests. This educational foundation, however, has been beneficial in his professional life.\n\nProfessionally, John works as a maintenance supervisor at a local manufacturing plant, earning an annual salary of $62,000. His job requires him to be proficient in English, which he speaks fluently, having learned it as his first language. He has been in his current role for about five years and has a stable employment history, having worked in various maintenance positions throughout his career.\n\nLiving with his older brother, who owns the house, John pays a modest rent of $800 per month, which includes utilities and internet. The house is a three-bedroom, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, with a mix of young families and retirees. John's brother, who is semi-retired, helps with some of the household chores, allowing John to focus on his hobbies and personal interests.\n\nJohn's economic concerns include saving for retirement, as he does not have a pension plan through his current job. He contributes to a 401(k) and aims to increase his savings rate over the next few years. Additionally, John is concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of economic downturns on his employment stability.\n\nIn terms of political views, John tends to lean conservative on fiscal issues, advocating for lower taxes and reduced government spending. However, he also supports social programs that benefit seniors and veterans, reflecting his personal connection to these groups through his brother and friends. John's voting decisions are often influenced by local issues, such as infrastructure development and natural resource management, given Wyoming's unique economic landscape.\n\nOverall, John's life is marked by stability and a strong connection to his community, but he also faces challenges related to long-term financial security and the broader economic trends affecting his region."
