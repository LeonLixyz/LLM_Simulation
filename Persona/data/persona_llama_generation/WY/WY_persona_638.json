  "PERSONA": "A 62-year-old white and American Indian woman, living in a homeless shelter in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married but separated from her husband, who is currently not providing financial support. Despite her current living situation, she holds a Master's degree in Social Work from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in 2001. Prior to becoming homeless, she worked as a counselor for a local non-profit organization focused on Native American affairs, earning an annual income of around $43,000. \n\nDue to a combination of factors, including a medical condition that led to her losing her job and her husband's decision to leave, she found herself unable to afford her rent and eventually became homeless. She is fluent in English and has a strong proficiency in the language. Her educational background and career in social work have given her a deep understanding of community resources, which she now utilizes to navigate her situation. \n\nAs a US-born citizen of mixed heritage, she identifies with both her white and American Indian roots, and her cultural background influences her perspectives on social justice and community welfare. She is concerned about affordable housing, access to healthcare, and support for homeless individuals, particularly those from Native American communities. Her current situation has made her acutely aware of the need for more comprehensive social safety nets and affordable housing options in Wyoming."
