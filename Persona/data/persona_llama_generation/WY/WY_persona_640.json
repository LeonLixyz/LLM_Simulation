  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Guti\u00e9rrez, a 48-year-old Mexican-American woman living in Casper, Wyoming. Born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Ana is a US citizen who speaks English fluently. She resides with her husband, Juan, in a two-bedroom apartment they rent in a suburban neighborhood for $900 per month. Ana's husband works as a mechanic at a local garage, earning a combined household income of around $55,000 annually. \n\nAna works part-time as a medical receptionist at a small clinic, earning $18 per hour for 25 hours a week, contributing around $22,000 to their household income. She attended Casper College for two years, studying business administration but did not graduate due to family obligations. Ana's education background has still allowed her to secure stable employment, which she values for its predictability and benefits.\n\nAna and Juan have been married for 23 years and have two children, Emily (19) and Michael (16). Emily is currently a sophomore at the University of Wyoming, studying to be a teacher, while Michael is a high school sophomore. The family is proud of their educational pursuits, but they face financial challenges in supporting Emily's college tuition. They have to budget carefully to ensure they can cover the $8,000 annual tuition fees.\n\nAna's economic concerns include affording healthcare, saving for retirement, and ensuring their children's educational expenses are covered. Given their income level, Ana is keenly aware of the need for affordable healthcare options and often advocates for policies that support working-class families like hers. She is also concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming and the impact of economic fluctuations on their household budget."
