  "PERSONA": "John Michael Thompson, a 49-year-old white male, born in Bozeman, Montana, but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Sarah, and they have two children, Emily (16) and James (13). John's family lives in a moderately sized, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they own with a mortgage.\n\nJohn's educational background includes completing two years at a local community college in Montana, where he studied business administration but did not graduate due to financial constraints. This educational experience has influenced his career trajectory, leading him to a stable but not highly lucrative job as a purchasing agent for a mid-sized manufacturing firm in Cheyenne.\n\nJohn's job at the manufacturing firm earns him an annual salary of $58,500, which, combined with his wife's income as a part-time nurse ($32,000 per year), provides a comfortable but not extravagant lifestyle for their family. The Thompsons have a combined household income of $90,500. They own two vehicles, a 2018 Ford F-150 for John and a 2020 Honda Odyssey for family use.\n\nAs a non-veteran, John does not have military experience, but he is proud of his family's military history, with his father having served in the Navy during the Gulf War. John is fluent in English and has no other languages spoken at home.\n\nGiven his economic situation, John's primary economic concerns are saving for his children's college education and ensuring the stability of his job in a somewhat volatile manufacturing sector. He is also keen on policies that support local businesses and community development, as he believes these are crucial for Cheyenne's economic growth and the well-being of its residents.\n\nJohn and his family enjoy outdoor activities that Wyoming offers, such as hiking and fishing, and are active members of their local community church. Their suburban lifestyle in Cheyenne provides them with a sense of security and community, which is important to John and his family."
