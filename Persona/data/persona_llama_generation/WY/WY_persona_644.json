  "PERSONA": "Name: Carlos Hernandez\n\nAge: 38 years\n\nSex: Male\n\nRace: Hispanic\nEthnicity: Mexican\n\nLocation: Casper, Wyoming (a mid-sized city in central Wyoming, with a mix of industrial and rural influences)\n\nFamily Structure: Carlos lives with his parents, Ana and Juan, in a modest single-family home in a predominantly working-class neighborhood. Carlos is married to his high school sweetheart, Maria, who is 36 years old. They have two children, Emily (8) and Jackson (5), who attend local public schools.\n\nMarital Status: Carlos and Maria have been married for 10 years and are considered \"now married, except separated\" due to Maria's temporary relocation to Denver, Colorado, for work. Maria works as a nurse, and her job requires frequent travel, but she returns to Casper every 2-3 weeks.\n\nEducation: Carlos is a high school graduate from Natrona County High School in Casper. He did not pursue higher education due to family obligations and a desire to enter the workforce immediately.\n\nCareer: Carlos works as a diesel mechanic at a local trucking company, earning $52,000 per year. He has been in this role for 7 years and is well-respected in his field.\n\nEconomic Situation: Carlos's annual household income is approximately $80,000, including Maria's income. They own their home, which they purchased 5 years ago for $180,000. The mortgage payments are $1,200 per month, which is manageable given their combined income.\n\nConcerns and Priorities: Carlos is concerned about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly the increasing cost of housing and healthcare. He is also worried about the impact of automation on his job as a diesel mechanic. As a result, he prioritizes economic stability, affordable education, and access to quality healthcare.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* Based on Carlos's age, education, and occupation, it is assumed that he did not attend college due to financial constraints or a desire to enter the workforce immediately.\n* Given the household income and expenses, it is assumed that Carlos and Maria have a moderate level of economic security, but are not immune to financial stress.\n\nThis persona is designed to reflect a specific individual within the provided demographic group, with a focus on factors that influence economic and political views."
