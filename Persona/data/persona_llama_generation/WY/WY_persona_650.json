  "PERSONA": "Meet Emily Wilson, a 57-year-old White female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides with her parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood. Emily is married to her husband, John, and they have been together for over 20 years, although they have not had children of their own.\n\nEmily holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained in 1990. After graduating, she worked as an administrative assistant for a local insurance company for over 15 years before deciding to take a break to care for her aging parents. Currently, Emily is not employed but is considering part-time work to supplement her husband's income.\n\nJohn, her husband, works as a manager at a local hardware store and earns around $55,000 per year. They own their home, which is valued at approximately $250,000, and have a mortgage with a monthly payment of $1,200. Emily's parents, who live with them, contribute $500 per month towards household expenses.\n\nEmily's family is her top priority, and she spends most of her time taking care of her parents and managing the household. Her parents' health issues and the rising cost of healthcare are significant concerns for her. She is also worried about her own retirement savings, as she has not been contributing to a 401(k) or IRA since leaving her full-time job.\n\nIn her free time, Emily enjoys volunteering at a local animal shelter and participating in community events. She is an avid reader and likes to stay informed about local and national politics. Emily's economic concerns include affordable healthcare, social security, and the impact of inflation on her family's budget. She tends to vote conservatively, prioritizing fiscal responsibility and small government intervention in economic matters."
