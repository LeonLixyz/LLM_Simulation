  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Morales, a 49-year-old Mexican-American woman living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides with her parents in a multi-generational household, a common arrangement in her close-knit Hispanic community. Ana is a non-veteran who has never married and has no dependents of her own, allowing her to focus on her career and contribute to her family's household income.\n\nAna holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Laramie County Community College. She speaks English fluently, having been born in the United States and educated in the local school system. Her proficiency in English has been a significant factor in her career advancement.\n\nAna works as a Bookkeeper for a small, family-owned construction firm in Cheyenne. She earns $43,000 per year, a moderate income that allows her to support herself and contribute to her family's expenses. Her job provides stability and a sense of security, which is essential to her economic priorities.\n\nAna's household is a mix of traditional and modern values. Her parents, who immigrated to the United States in the 1980s, maintain strong ties to their Mexican heritage, while Ana has adopted more American customs. This blend of cultures influences her economic and political views, as she navigates the complexities of being a first-generation American.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ana is acutely aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry. Her family's construction business has experienced fluctuations in demand due to the boom-and-bust nature of the industry. This has made Ana cautious about the state's economic future and more inclined to support policies that promote diversification and stability.\n\nAna's economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and education. She believes that investing in local education and workforce development programs is crucial for Wyoming's long-term prosperity. Her experience as a bookkeeper has also made her sensitive to the need for responsible fiscal management and transparent government spending.\n\nIn her free time, Ana enjoys volunteering at a local non-profit organization that provides financial literacy training to low-income families. This work has deepened her understanding of the economic challenges faced by her community and reinforced her commitment to advocating for policies that support economic mobility and social justice."
