  "PERSONA": "Meet Judith Thompson, a 68-year-old White female who has been the primary householder of her residence in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Despite being listed as 'Never married' in the metadata, a reasonable assumption based on her being the primary householder in a 'Married-couple Without kids' household is that she is either in a long-term, unmarried partnership or the marital status classification may be an error, and she is actually married. For the purpose of this persona, let's assume she is in a long-term, unmarried partnership with her 70-year-old partner, John, a retired mechanic.\n\nJudith holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained in 1978. She has always been passionate about environmental conservation and has worked for over three decades in the state's environmental protection agency, eventually retiring as a Senior Environmental Specialist in 2015. Her annual pension is $48,000, supplemented by John's retirement income from his mechanic work, which totals $60,000 per year. They own their home, a modest, energy-efficient house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, valued at $320,000.\n\nJudith and John have no children but are avid outdoor enthusiasts, often spending their free time hiking and camping in Wyoming's national parks. They are concerned about the impact of climate change on their state's natural beauty and economic stability, particularly the decline of coal mining jobs and the need for diversified, sustainable industries.\n\nGiven her educational background and career, Judith is well-informed about environmental issues and is politically active in local conservation efforts. Her economic concerns include ensuring a stable retirement, maintaining access to quality healthcare, and promoting sustainable economic development in Wyoming that balances environmental protection with job creation. She speaks English fluently and has never had to learn another language, given her birth and upbringing in Wyoming. Judith's specific economic situation, educational background, and long-term residence in Wyoming shape her views on environmental policy, economic development, and social issues, making her a unique and informed voice in her community."
