  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson, a 79-year-old white male living in the small town of Cody, Wyoming, in the northwestern part of the state. He resides with his 102-year-old mother in a single-family home that has been in the family for over 50 years. Harold never married, dedicating his life to caring for his parents after his father passed away when he was in his mid-30s.\n\nHarold holds a Bachelor's degree in Agriculture from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 1967. After college, he worked as an agricultural inspector for the state of Wyoming for over 30 years, earning a modest income of around $45,000 per year until his retirement in 2002. His job allowed him to stay close to his family and contribute to the local community.\n\nGiven his stable but modest income, Harold has always been mindful of his expenses. He owns the family home outright, having paid off the mortgage in the 1990s. He has some savings, approximately $150,000, which he has set aside for his mother's care and his own retirement. He also receives a monthly Social Security benefit of around $1,800.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of Wyoming, Harold is deeply rooted in the local culture and is concerned about the economic implications of the state's reliance on the energy industry. He is particularly worried about the impact of economic downturns on the local community and the availability of healthcare services for seniors like himself and his mother.\n\nHarold's education and career have instilled in him a strong sense of civic duty and community involvement. He volunteers at the local senior center and participates in town hall meetings, where he advocates for policies that support seniors and the local economy. His economic priorities include ensuring affordable healthcare, maintaining social security benefits, and promoting sustainable economic development in rural areas like Cody.\n\nAssumptions made based on missing metadata include:\n- Assuming Harold's ethnicity is non-Hispanic, given his white race and lack of any other ethnicity information.\n- Assuming Harold's household type is a single-family household, given that he lives with his mother.\n- Assuming Harold's language proficiency is high, given that he speaks English well and has a bachelor's degree from an American university."
