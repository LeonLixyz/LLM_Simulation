  "PERSONA": "Juan Morales, a 49-year-old Mexican-American male, lives with his parents in a single-family home in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As a divorced individual, he shares custody of his 10-year-old daughter, Sophia, who splits her time between his residence and her mother's apartment in the same neighborhood. Juan's parents, who immigrated to the United States from Mexico in their youth, own the house where he resides, significantly reducing his living expenses.\n\nJuan works as a skilled maintenance technician at a local manufacturing plant, with a yearly income of $58,000. His job stability and decent income enable him to contribute to his daughter's upbringing and help his parents with household expenses. Despite the comfortable living arrangement, Juan aims to move into his own home in the near future, citing a desire for independence and a more stable environment for his daughter.\n\nA high school graduate, Juan has considered furthering his education but has not yet pursued it due to work and family responsibilities. His proficiency in English has been beneficial in his career, allowing him to effectively communicate with his colleagues and supervisors. Born and raised in Wyoming, Juan identifies strongly with his Mexican heritage and American upbringing, often finding himself balancing cultural traditions with the realities of living in a predominantly non-Hispanic state.\n\nJuan's primary economic concerns revolve around saving for his daughter's education and securing a stable financial future for himself. He hopes to purchase a home in the next five years and is interested in learning more about available assistance programs for first-time homebuyers. As a single father, he also worries about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on his job security.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Juan is exposed to the state's strong conservative leanings but tends to identify as a moderate, weighing the pros and cons of each policy before forming an opinion. His experiences as a single father and a member of the Hispanic community in a predominantly white state have made him more empathetic to the challenges faced by underrepresented groups, often finding himself at the intersection of conservative and liberal views on social and economic issues."
