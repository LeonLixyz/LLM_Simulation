  "PERSONA": "Meet Barbara Thompson, a 68-year-old White female residing in Casper, Wyoming. She is married to her 72-year-old husband, John, a retired high school principal. Barbara is a US-born citizen, born in Wyoming, and has spent most of her life in the state. She holds a strong sense of local pride and community involvement.\n\nBarbara's educational background includes two years of college, where she studied early childhood education. Although she didn't complete her degree, her education experience laid the foundation for her work as a preschool teacher's assistant for over 15 years. She left the workforce 10 years ago to care for her aging mother, who has since passed away.\n\nThe Thompsons own a single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood, valued at approximately $280,000. They have two adult children, both living outside of Wyoming. Their son, Michael, is a software engineer in Denver, and their daughter, Emily, is a nurse practitioner in Seattle. Barbara and John have two grandkids, whom they see during summer visits.\n\nBarbara's primary concerns are related to healthcare and social security. As a recipient of public coverage, she is deeply invested in the future of Medicare and Medicaid. Her husband's retirement benefits and her own social security benefits make up a significant portion of their household income, which totals around $125,000 per year. They also receive a small pension from John's teaching career.\n\nAs a retiree, Barbara stays active in her community by volunteering at local charities and participating in neighborhood initiatives. Her economic priorities include preserving social security, maintaining affordable healthcare, and ensuring a stable financial future for her family. Barbara's views on economic policies are shaped by her experiences as a caregiver, her reliance on public coverage, and her desire to protect her family's financial security."
