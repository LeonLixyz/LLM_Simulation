  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson, an 87-year-old divorced female, lives with her granddaughter's family in a single-family home in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Illinois, she moved to Wyoming 15 years ago to be closer to her family after her divorce. Agnes is a high school graduate, having completed her education in the late 1940s, and worked as a part-time administrative assistant at a local elementary school for nearly two decades before retiring in 1992. She has been living with her granddaughter's family for the past 10 years, following the passing of her second husband, to whom she was married for 20 years before his death in 2005. Her granddaughter, a married mother of two, is a nurse at a local hospital, and her husband works as an accountant in a small firm.\n\nAgnes's economic situation is relatively stable, relying on a combination of her late husband's pension and her Social Security benefits, which amount to approximately $2,200 per month. Her living expenses are minimal, as her granddaughter's family covers most of the household costs. She owns a small, paid-off condominium in Cheyenne, which she inherited from her late husband, valued at around $180,000. However, due to her age and mobility issues, she has not been able to maintain the property and has been considering selling it.\n\nAgnes's primary economic concerns revolve around healthcare and long-term care costs. As she ages, she worries about the financial burden her health issues might place on her granddaughter's family. Her current health insurance, a combination of Medicare and supplemental coverage, has been sufficient so far, but she is concerned about potential changes in healthcare policies affecting her coverage.\n\nIn terms of education, Agnes places a high value on it, having seen its impact on her granddaughter's career. However, she believes that the current education system is too focused on standardized testing and not enough on practical skills. Her economic priorities include ensuring that her granddaughter's children have access to quality education without accumulating excessive student debt.\n\nGiven her age and life experience, Agnes tends to be conservative in her economic views, preferring fiscal responsibility and caution over significant policy changes. However, she is open to progressive ideas that prioritize the well-being of seniors and support for families with young children."
