  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male, born and raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder in a married-couple household without kids. Ryan is married to his wife, Sarah, whom he met while attending community college. They have been married for 8 years, having decided to focus on their careers before starting a family.\n\nRyan's educational background includes two years of study at Laramie County Community College, where he pursued an associate's degree in business administration but did not complete it due to financial constraints. Despite this, he was able to secure a job as an office manager at a local insurance company in Cheyenne, where he has worked for the past 10 years. His annual salary is $62,000.\n\nRyan and his wife own a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, with a mortgage of $1,200 per month. Their home is valued at $280,000, and they have been paying it off for the past 7 years. They also own two vehicles: a 2018 Ford F-150 for Ryan's daily commute and a 2020 Honda CR-V for Sarah's use.\n\nRyan's primary concerns are related to healthcare costs, as his wife has a chronic condition that requires ongoing medical treatment. He is also worried about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing prices of housing and groceries. As a result, Ryan prioritizes economic policies that aim to reduce healthcare costs and promote affordable housing.\n\nRyan speaks English fluently and only speaks English at home. He identifies as a US citizen and has never served in the military. He is active in his community, volunteering at local events and participating in neighborhood initiatives. Ryan's economic situation and family responsibilities shape his views on economic and political issues, with a focus on practical solutions that benefit working-class families like his own."
