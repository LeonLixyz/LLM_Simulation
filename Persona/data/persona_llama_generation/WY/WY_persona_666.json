  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ethan is a US-born citizen and speaks English fluently, having grown up in the same state where he currently resides. He is married, but due to his living situation, it's assumed that he and his spouse are in a long-distance relationship or a situation where they cannot live together full-time. Ethan has an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Laramie County Community College, which he earned after completing a two-year program.\n\nEthan works as a full-time Automotive Technician at a local car dealership in Cheyenne, earning around $52,000 per year. His job involves diagnosing and repairing problems with domestic and foreign vehicles, which he enjoys due to his passion for cars. Ethan's income, while modest, is stable and contributes significantly to the household income, as he lives with his parents.\n\nEthan's decision to live with his parents is largely driven by economic considerations. Wyoming has a relatively low cost of living compared to other states, but Cheyenne, being the state capital, has a slightly higher cost of living than other parts of the state. Ethan's parents own their home, which they have lived in for over two decades, and Ethan's contribution helps with utilities and other expenses. This arrangement allows Ethan to save money, which he hopes to use for a down payment on a house in the future.\n\nEthan's family structure is close-knit, with his parents being his primary support system. His parents, both in their early sixties, are retired and live on a fixed income. Ethan's father was a former mechanic, which influenced Ethan's choice of career. Ethan's mother was a school teacher before she retired. Ethan does not have any children of his own but has a younger sister who is away at college, studying to be a teacher.\n\nGiven his living situation and career, Ethan's economic concerns are centered around saving for a down payment on a house, managing the cost of living in Cheyenne, and ensuring he has enough savings for unexpected expenses. Politically, Ethan is likely to support policies that benefit the middle class, promote affordable housing, and support small businesses and local economic development. His experience living with his parents and seeing their challenges with retirement savings might also make him supportive of policies aimed at strengthening social security and retirement benefits."
