  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old White male living in the small town of Cody, Wyoming. Ryan is a US-born citizen and a veteran who has recently returned to live with his parents in their family home, a modest single-story house on the outskirts of town, due to financial difficulties following his military service.\n\nRyan is married to his wife, Sarah, whom he met during his time in the service. The couple does not have any children together, but Ryan's wife has a 10-year-old son from a previous relationship, who lives with them part-time. Despite being married, Ryan and his wife are currently experiencing marital difficulties and are separated, with Sarah living in a nearby apartment and Ryan staying with his parents.\n\nRyan graduated from Cody High School and did not pursue further education due to his enlistment in the military. He served in the US Army for six years, primarily working in logistics and supply chain management. After being honorably discharged, Ryan struggled to find stable employment in Wyoming, eventually taking a job as a warehouse manager at a local retail store, earning an annual salary of $42,000.\n\nRyan's economic concerns are centered around providing for his family, paying off his significant student loan debt from vocational training after his military service, and saving for a down payment on a home. He feels that his current living situation with his parents, although temporary, is a setback in his life and wishes to establish a more independent household with his wife and stepson.\n\nRyan's experience as a veteran has given him a strong sense of patriotism and loyalty to his community. He is involved in local veteran organizations and volunteers his time to help other veterans adjust to civilian life. Despite his current financial struggles, Ryan is optimistic about his future, hoping to start his own business in logistics and create jobs for other veterans in the area.\n\nRyan's family background and upbringing in Wyoming have instilled in him a strong work ethic and a love for the outdoors. He spends his free time fishing, hiking, and participating in local rodeos, which he believes helps him connect with his community and maintain a sense of identity."
