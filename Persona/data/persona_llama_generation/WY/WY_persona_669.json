  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 22-year-old White male, born and raised in the state of Wyoming, specifically in the town of Jackson, a popular tourist destination known for its natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities. Ethan is a non-veteran, US citizen who speaks English fluently, having grown up in a predominantly English-speaking household. He is the youngest child of a two-parent household, currently living with his parents in a suburban neighborhood in Jackson.\n\nEthan recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, with a focus on conservation biology. This educational background has instilled in him a deep appreciation for the natural world and a commitment to sustainability. Given his interests and skills, Ethan is currently employed as an environmental technician for a local non-profit organization, earning an annual salary of $43,000. His job involves monitoring water quality in Wyoming's rivers and streams, as well as assisting with conservation efforts in the area.\n\nEthan's economic situation is relatively stable, thanks to his full-time job and the support of his parents, who own a modest home in the suburbs. Ethan contributes to the household income but does not pay rent, allowing him to save for his future goals. His family's financial stability and his own modest income enable him to enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking and fishing, in his free time.\n\nAs a child living with his parents, Ethan's family structure is traditional and supportive. His parents, both in their mid-50s, have been married for over 25 years and work as a high school teacher and a small business owner, respectively. Ethan's older sibling, a sister, is a graduate student at a nearby university. The family's close-knit dynamic and shared values have shaped Ethan's perspective on life and influenced his priorities, which include environmental conservation, community engagement, and financial responsibility.\n\nEthan's geographic location in Wyoming has a significant impact on his economic and political views. The state's strong tradition of individualism and limited government intervention resonates with Ethan, who values personal freedom and autonomy. However, his work in environmental conservation has also made him aware of the importance of government regulation in protecting natural resources. As a result, Ethan's views on economic policy tend to balance individual liberty with a recognition of the need for responsible governance.\n\nIn terms of economic concerns, Ethan is particularly interested in policies that support sustainable development, renewable energy, and job creation in the environmental sector. He is also concerned about the impact of tourism on local communities and the need for responsible management of Wyoming's natural resources."
