  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson, a 79-year-old white female, is a retired high school English teacher living in a small, single-family home in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She has been married to her husband, John, a 82-year-old retired mechanic, for 55 years, although they have been separated due to health reasons, with John currently residing in a nearby assisted living facility.\n\nAgnes is a lifelong resident of the United States, born in Billings, Montana, but has called Wyoming home for the past 40 years. She is a US citizen and speaks English fluently, having never learned another language. Agnes graduated from high school in Montana and later pursued a teaching certification program at the University of Wyoming.\n\nAs a retired teacher, Agnes is comfortable financially, with a monthly pension of $4,200 and supplemental income from Social Security. Her annual household income is approximately $60,000. She owns her home, which is valued at $220,000, with a remaining mortgage balance of $80,000. Agnes is responsible for managing the household finances and makes most of the financial decisions.\n\nAgnes's primary economic concerns are healthcare costs, as her husband's long-term care expenses are significant, and she worries about the potential impact on her own financial security. She is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly the increasing property taxes on her home.\n\nAs a widow-to-be, Agnes's family structure is changing, and she is adjusting to living alone after decades of marriage. She has no children, but has two nieces and a nephew who live in nearby states and visit occasionally. Agnes is active in her community, volunteering at a local literacy program and participating in a book club at her church.\n\nGiven her age and health concerns, Agnes is particularly interested in policies related to healthcare, Social Security, and retirement security. She is a moderate conservative and values individual responsibility, but also believes in a strong social safety net for vulnerable populations."
