  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 57-year-old White female who resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the sister of the household's primary resident, Karen lives with her brother and his family in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood. Karen is divorced and has been so for about 8 years. She has a 25-year-old daughter who lives independently in a nearby city and works as a nurse.\n\nKaren holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Laramie County Community College. She has worked as an office manager at a local veterinary clinic for the past 15 years, earning an annual salary of $48,500. This job provides her with a stable income and benefits, which are essential for her economic well-being.\n\nKaren was born in Casper, Wyoming, but has lived in Cheyenne for over 20 years. She is a US citizen by birth and has never lived outside the United States. Karen speaks English fluently, having learned it as her native language, and has no proficiency in any other languages.\n\nKaren's economic concerns include saving for retirement, as she expects to retire within the next 8-10 years. She also prioritizes maintaining affordable healthcare and ensuring her daughter's financial stability. As a resident of Wyoming, Karen is mindful of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and worries about the impact of economic fluctuations on her community.\n\nIn terms of homeownership, Karen's brother owns the house they live in, but she contributes to the household expenses, including mortgage payments and utilities. She has considered purchasing a condominium in the area but has not yet made a decision due to uncertainty about her retirement plans.\n\nKaren's educational background has served her well in her career, providing her with the necessary skills to manage the office at the veterinary clinic efficiently. However, she sometimes feels that her Associate's degree limits her opportunities for career advancement, particularly in terms of salary growth.\n\nKaren's family structure and responsibilities are centered around her relationship with her brother and his family, as well as her daughter, who occasionally visits. Her marital status as divorced has not significantly impacted her economic situation, as she has maintained a stable income and support system throughout the years."
