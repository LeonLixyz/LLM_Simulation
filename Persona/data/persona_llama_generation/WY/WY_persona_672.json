  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 62-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, living in a suburban neighborhood in Casper, Wyoming. He resides with his parents in their single-family home, which they have owned for over 20 years. Juan's marital status is married, but he and his wife, Maria, have been separated for the past five years, yet remain legally married. They have two adult children, both of whom have moved out of the family home.\n\nJuan was born in Wyoming and has lived there his entire life. He is a US citizen and speaks English fluently, having learned it as his primary language from a young age. His parents, who immigrated to the US from Mexico when Juan was a child, have been naturalized citizens since the 1980s. \n\nJuan's educational background includes completing two years of college at Casper College, where he studied business administration. However, he did not complete his degree due to family obligations and the need to enter the workforce early. This educational foundation has helped him secure a stable job as an office manager at a local insurance company in Casper, where he has worked for over 15 years. His annual income is around $55,000, which, combined with his wife's income as a part-time nurse, allows them to support their family and contribute to their children's education.\n\nJuan's household income is supplemented by his parents' social security benefits and a small pension from his father's previous job as a miner. Juan's economic concerns include saving for retirement, as he is approaching the age of eligibility for social security benefits, and ensuring his children can afford their own education and living expenses.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Juan does not have any direct experience with the military, but his uncle, who served in the US Army, has influenced his views on patriotism and community service. Juan is an active member of his local community, volunteering at the Casper Chamber of Commerce and participating in local events.\n\nJuan's living situation, with his parents and his own marital separation, presents unique economic and social challenges. His experience living with his parents, who are in their 80s, has given him a deeper understanding of the importance of social security, Medicare, and accessible healthcare for seniors. His separation from his wife has also made him more aware of the need for affordable healthcare and the economic implications of divorce on families.\n\nJuan's economic priorities include maintaining a stable job, saving for retirement, and ensuring his family's access to quality, affordable healthcare. His political views tend to lean towards supporting policies that benefit working-class families, seniors, and the local community, with a strong emphasis on economic stability and social welfare programs."
