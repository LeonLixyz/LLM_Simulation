  "PERSONA": "John Hansen, a 69-year-old retired male of White race, resides in the small town of Jackson, Wyoming. He is the primary householder of his single-family home, located in a suburban neighborhood with a mix of retirees and families. John is now married, except separated, meaning he is currently living apart from his wife due to health reasons. His wife, who suffers from dementia, resides in a local care facility.\n\nJohn is a non-veteran but has a strong appreciation for the military service, as his father was a veteran of World War II. He speaks English well but also speaks German fluently, having learned it from his parents who were both of German descent, which accounts for his \"Other Indo-European languages\" classification.\n\nJohn holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming. His graduate degree led him to a successful career as an Environmental Consultant, working with local government agencies and private companies to develop sustainable land use plans. He worked in this field for over 30 years before retiring at 65.\n\nBorn in Wyoming, John has always been proud of his state's natural beauty and has been involved in local conservation efforts throughout his life. As a US citizen, he values his right to vote and actively participates in local and national elections, prioritizing environmental issues and access to quality healthcare.\n\nJohn's current annual income from his retirement accounts and part-time consulting work is approximately $55,000. He owns his home outright, having paid off his mortgage a decade ago. His primary economic concerns are related to healthcare costs, particularly for his wife's care, and the potential impact of environmental policies on his community."
