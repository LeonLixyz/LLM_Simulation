  "PERSONA": "Alex Thompson, a 28-year-old white male, living in a two-story family home in the suburban outskirts of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Boise, Idaho, he moved to Wyoming with his family at the age of 10. As the youngest of three siblings, Alex resides with his parents, John and Sarah, both in their early fifties. His father works as a high school history teacher, and his mother is a part-time librarian at the local community college.\n\nAlex has an Associate's degree in Computer Networking from Laramie County Community College, which he completed two years ago. He works full-time as a network administrator at a small IT firm in downtown Cheyenne, earning an annual salary of $52,000. Although he has been considering furthering his education to a Bachelor's degree, the financial burden and the current stability of his job have put those plans on hold.\n\nAs a non-veteran and never married, Alex's primary focus is on his career advancement and financial security. He is fluent in English, having grown up speaking it as his first language, and has not been exposed to any other languages at home. His economic concerns revolve around saving for a down payment on a house, paying off his student loans, and navigating the rising costs of living in Wyoming, which has seen significant growth in recent years.\n\nAlex's family owns their home, which has been a significant factor in his decision to continue living with them, allowing him to save money and pay off his debts more efficiently. His parents, though encouraging him to move out and start his own life, understand his financial situation and are supportive of his current living arrangement.\n\nIn his free time, Alex enjoys hiking and camping in the nearby mountains, practices photography, and volunteers at a local animal shelter. His economic priorities include affordable healthcare, education, and infrastructure development, which he believes are crucial for Wyoming's future growth and his own career prospects."
