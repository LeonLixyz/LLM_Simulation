  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 57-year-old divorced white female, living in a unique household arrangement in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born and raised in Wyoming, Karen is a lifelong resident of the state, having grown up in a small town before moving to the state capital for college and career opportunities.\n\nKaren's educational background includes a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 1990. This degree led to a successful career in banking, where she worked her way up to become a branch manager at a local bank. However, after her divorce in 2010, Karen decided to take a step back from her career to focus on her personal life and family. She now works part-time as a financial advisor, helping individuals and small businesses manage their finances.\n\nKaren's household situation is somewhat unconventional; she lives with her parents, both in their early eighties, in a spacious family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne. This arrangement allows her to care for her aging parents while also having her own space and independence. Her parents own the house, which they purchased in the 1980s, and Karen contributes to the household expenses.\n\nAs a divorced individual, Karen's economic situation is relatively stable, but she is cautious with her finances. She has a modest income of around $45,000 per year from her part-time job and receives a small alimony payment from her ex-husband. Karen's primary economic concerns include ensuring her parents' financial security, saving for her own retirement, and maintaining her independence.\n\nKaren's experience as a child living with her parents at an older age has given her a unique perspective on family dynamics and caregiving. She values the importance of family support and is committed to caring for her parents as they age. This experience also influences her views on social and economic policies related to caregiving, healthcare, and financial security for seniors.\n\nIn terms of her views on economic and political issues, Karen tends to be fiscally conservative, advocating for responsible government spending and lower taxes. However, she also supports social programs that benefit seniors and low-income families, reflecting her personal experiences and values. Karen is an English-speaking US citizen, born and raised in Wyoming, and her views are shaped by her local community and the state's cultural and economic context."
