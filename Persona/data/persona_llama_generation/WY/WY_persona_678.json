  "PERSONA": "Meet Maria Rodriguez, a 62-year-old white female who is the primary householder of her single-person household in a cozy condominium in downtown Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Maria moved to the United States 20 years ago for educational and career opportunities. She holds a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Denver, which has been instrumental in her career as a financial analyst in the energy sector. She currently works as a senior financial analyst for a mid-sized company specializing in renewable energy solutions, earning an annual salary of $85,000.\n\nMaria is married but has been separated from her husband for the past five years, and they have not yet finalized their divorce. Her husband, also from Argentina, works in a different city, and their separation was largely due to the demands of their careers. Maria has no children and does not have any dependents.\n\nAs a non-U.S. citizen, Maria has a green card and is in the process of applying for citizenship. She speaks English fluently, having learned it as a second language in her teenage years. Maria is proud of her Latin American heritage and actively participates in local cultural events, especially those related to Argentine traditions.\n\nMaria's educational background and career have provided her with a comfortable lifestyle. She owns her condominium, which she purchased 10 years ago, and has been diligently paying off her mortgage. Her economic concerns include saving for retirement, as she plans to retire in the next five years, and ensuring she has adequate healthcare coverage. Maria is also keenly interested in environmental policies, given her work in the renewable energy sector, and supports initiatives that promote sustainable development.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Maria appreciates the state's natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities. However, she is concerned about the state's limited public transportation options and the impact of the energy industry on local ecosystems. Maria's economic priorities include supporting local businesses, investing in sustainable technologies, and advocating for policies that balance economic growth with environmental protection.\n\nAs a resident of Cheyenne, Maria is familiar with the local economy's reliance on the energy sector and its implications for the community. Her specific geographic location and professional background influence her economic and political views, making her a unique voice in Wyoming's demographic landscape."
