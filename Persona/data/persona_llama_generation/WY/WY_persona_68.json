  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old White female, born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and currently living with her parents in a suburban neighborhood in Casper, Wyoming. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Tyler, but they are temporarily separated due to his work as a seasonal oil rig worker. Alex has an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Casper College, which she completed in two years while working part-time as a receptionist.\n\nAlex is employed full-time as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Casper, earning $29,500 annually. Her job involves handling customer inquiries, managing paperwork, and providing general administrative support to the office staff. She has private health insurance through her employer and is generally satisfied with her job, although she hopes to advance to a higher-paying position in the future.\n\nAlex's parents, both in their late 50s, own a modest single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood, where Alex and Tyler have a small apartment in the basement. Alex contributes $500 monthly to the household expenses, which helps her parents with the mortgage and utilities. Her parents are supportive of her and Tyler's decision to live with them temporarily while they save money for their own home.\n\nAlex's education and career choices have been influenced by her desire for stability and security. She chose to pursue an Associate's degree to quickly enter the workforce and gain practical skills. Her experience as an administrative assistant has taught her the importance of organization, communication, and attention to detail.\n\nAs a young adult, Alex is concerned about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing housing costs and the impact of the energy industry's fluctuations on local jobs. She is also worried about access to affordable healthcare, especially for her parents, who are approaching retirement age. These concerns shape her views on economic policies, such as affordable housing initiatives, job training programs, and healthcare reform.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking, reading, and volunteering at a local animal shelter. She and Tyler are planning to save money to buy their own home in the next few years and start a family."
