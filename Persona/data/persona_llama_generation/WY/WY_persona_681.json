  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 49-year-old white female, born in Denver, Colorado, but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a high school graduate with a certificate in cosmetology from a local community college. Alex is a divorced primary householder, previously married for 10 years before her divorce 5 years ago. Despite the divorce, she maintains a positive relationship with her ex-husband for the sake of their shared business, a small, successful hair salon in downtown Cheyenne. The salon is a partnership, with Alex focusing on managing the daily operations and her ex-husband handling the finances.\n\nAlex is a non-veteran and has always been a U.S. citizen, having been born in the United States. She speaks English fluently and has no known proficiency in any other language. Her household is currently classified as a married-couple without kids, as she has recently remarried a man named Ryan, whom she met through mutual friends. Ryan is a software engineer working remotely for a company based in California, allowing them the flexibility to live in Wyoming.\n\nTheir household income is approximately $85,000 per year, with Alex contributing around $45,000 from the salon and Ryan's remote job providing the remainder. They own a modest, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, with a mortgage of about $1,200 per month. The house is valued at around $280,000 and serves as their primary residence.\n\nAlex's primary economic concerns include maintaining a stable income from the salon, managing the costs associated with homeownership, and saving for retirement. Her educational background has served her well in her career as a hairstylist and salon manager, but she occasionally considers further education or training to stay competitive in the industry. Her experience as a small business owner and her role in managing the salon's day-to-day operations have given her a unique perspective on local economic issues, particularly those affecting small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex is keenly aware of the state's reliance on the energy industry and the fluctuations in the economy that come with it. She is also concerned about the availability and affordability of healthcare in rural areas, having experienced challenges in accessing specialized care for a family member in the past. These concerns, along with her experience as a small business owner and her observations of the local economy, shape her economic and political views, making her a pragmatic and community-focused individual."
