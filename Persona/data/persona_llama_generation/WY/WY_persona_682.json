  "PERSONA": "Rohan Jain, a 38-year-old Asian Indian male, is the primary householder of his single-person household in a modest, two-bedroom condominium in downtown Cheyenne, Wyoming. Rohan was born in Mumbai, India, but spent his formative years in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before immigrating to the United States with his family at the age of 15. He became a U.S. citizen in 2008.\n\nRohan holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Wyoming, which he completed in 2010. After working several years as a software engineer for various startups, Rohan transitioned to a more stable role as an IT Project Manager at the Wyoming State Government, where he earns $83,000 annually. His wife, whom he married in 2015, is a dentist and works part-time at a local clinic.\n\nAs a primary householder without kids, Rohan has the financial flexibility to focus on his career and personal interests. He is fluent in English, having spoken it as his primary language since moving to the United States, and has maintained a strong proficiency in Gujarati, his native language. Rohan's economic concerns center around saving for a potential down payment on a single-family home, paying off his wife's dental school loans, and planning for long-term retirement.\n\nRohan and his wife rent their condominium for $1,400 per month, which is slightly above the average rent in Cheyenne. They have a combined income of $143,000, allowing them to enjoy a relatively comfortable lifestyle, including frequent hiking trips in the nearby mountains and trying out new restaurants in downtown Cheyenne.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Rohan does not have any specific benefits or concerns related to military service. His primary focus is on advancing his career, building a stable financial foundation, and enjoying the quality of life that Cheyenne offers."
