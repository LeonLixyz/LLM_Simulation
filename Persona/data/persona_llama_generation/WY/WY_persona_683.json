  "PERSONA": "Meet Sarah Jenkins, a 38-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is a widow, having lost her husband three years ago in a work-related accident. Prior to his passing, they were married for ten years and had two children together, Emily (12) and Ryan (9). Sarah currently resides in a single-family home they purchased in 2010, valued at approximately $220,000, with a mortgage of $150,000. \n\nSarah's educational background includes two years of community college, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. She works part-time as a receptionist at a local medical office, earning around $28,000 per year. Her job provides health insurance, which is crucial for her family's well-being, especially since her children have recurring medical needs.\n\nAs a single parent, Sarah's primary economic concerns revolve around ensuring her children's education and healthcare needs are met while managing the mortgage payments on their home. She is particularly interested in local and national policies that support affordable healthcare, education, and housing initiatives. Given her experience as a widow, she also advocates for policies that assist families who have lost a primary breadwinner.\n\nSarah is a native of Wyoming, born and raised in the city of Cheyenne. She moved to Casper after marrying her husband, who was from the area. Her English proficiency is native-like, and she only speaks English at home and in her daily interactions. Sarah's household income is supplemented by her late husband's life insurance policy, which provides a modest monthly stipple. However, she is keenly aware of the need for policies that support economic stability for families like hers.\n\nGiven her situation, Sarah is likely to be interested in political discussions around economic security, healthcare access, and education affordability. Her experiences as a widow and a single mother working in the service sector provide her with a unique perspective on these issues, and she is likely to support candidates and policies that address these concerns directly."
