  "PERSONA": "Meet Jack Harris, a 49-year-old white male with some Native American ancestry, living in Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder of his single-person household, Jack has never been married and has no children. He is a US-born citizen and a veteran of the US Army, having served for eight years before being honorably discharged with the rank of Sergeant. \n\nJack speaks English fluently and holds a high school diploma from Natrona County High School in Casper, Wyoming. After his military service, Jack utilized his GI Bill benefits to attend a vocational training program in diesel mechanics, which led to his current job as a diesel mechanic at a local trucking company. His annual income is approximately $55,000, and he has been working in this field for over 15 years.\n\nJack rents a modest two-bedroom apartment in a working-class neighborhood in Casper for $800 per month. He has considered buying a home but prefers the flexibility of renting, which allows him to allocate more funds towards his hobbies and saving for retirement. Jack's economic priorities include maintaining a stable job, saving for retirement, and ensuring he has sufficient health insurance coverage.\n\nAs a veteran and a blue-collar worker, Jack's economic concerns are centered around job security, access to affordable healthcare, and the overall economic well-being of his community. He is particularly interested in policies that support local businesses and veterans' welfare. Jack's political views tend to lean conservative, but he is open to supporting policies from either side of the aisle that directly benefit his community and address his economic concerns."
