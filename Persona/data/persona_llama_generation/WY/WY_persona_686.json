  "PERSONA": "Harold Jenkins, a 79-year-old white male, has been living in a homeless shelter in Casper, Wyoming, for the past three years. Assuming his ethnicity to be non-Hispanic due to the lack of information, Harold was born in the United States, specifically in Montana, but has called Wyoming home for over two decades. As a US citizen, he has always spoken English fluently, having learned it as his first language.\n\nHarold's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied automotive repair before dropping out due to financial constraints. This education has helped him find short-term, low-paying jobs in mechanics throughout his life, though he has been unable to secure stable employment in recent years.\n\nAs a never-married individual, Harold does not have a spouse or children to support. However, he does have a younger sister living in Idaho, whom he occasionally keeps in touch with through letters.\n\nPrior to becoming homeless, Harold rented a small apartment in a low-income neighborhood in Casper, where he worked as a part-time handyman. However, after losing his job due to health issues and being unable to pay his rent, Harold found himself without a permanent residence. He now resides in a local homeless shelter, where he receives basic amenities and some assistance in finding employment.\n\nGiven his situation, Harold's primary economic concerns include accessing affordable healthcare, finding stable employment, and securing permanent housing. He relies on government assistance programs and local charities to get by. Politically, Harold is likely to support policies that address homelessness, improve access to affordable healthcare for low-income individuals, and create job opportunities in his community."
