  "PERSONA": "Meet Jack Harris, a 62-year-old White male living in Casper, Wyoming. Born in Oregon, Jack moved to Wyoming about 10 years ago to live with his aging parents, 85-year-old George and 82-year-old Margaret, in their family home in a suburban neighborhood. This living arrangement allows Jack to care for his parents while also keeping costs low, as he still pays a modest monthly rent to contribute to household expenses. Jack's parents own the house, which they purchased in the early 2000s for $180,000. The house, valued at $240,000 today, is fully paid off, providing a stable and secure living environment.\n\nJack is divorced, having ended his 15-year marriage to his high school sweetheart, Sarah, about 7 years ago. They have no children together, which has allowed Jack to focus on rebuilding his life and career after the divorce. Jack works as a part-time mechanic at a local car repair shop, earning $35,000 per year. His job is relatively stable, but he struggles to make ends meet due to the modest income. Jack attended a local community college for two years after high school, studying automotive repair, but did not complete his degree. Despite this, he has built a reputation as a skilled mechanic in the community.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Jack does not receive any military benefits. He speaks English fluently and has no known disabilities. Jack's economic concerns center around ensuring his parents receive proper care as they age, managing his own retirement, and maintaining a stable income in a region with limited job opportunities. He is likely to prioritize policies that support affordable healthcare, social security, and local economic development. Living in a conservative state like Wyoming, Jack's political views are moderately conservative, influenced by his rural upbringing and the economic realities of his community."
