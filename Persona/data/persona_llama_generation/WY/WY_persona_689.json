  "PERSONA": "Kaito Nakamura, a 78-year-old Asian male, lives alone in a modest, single-story home in a quiet neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born and raised in the United States, Kaito's family roots are in the broader Asian community, with his parents having immigrated from the Philippines.\n\nKaito never married and has no children, focusing his life on his career and personal interests. He attended Casper College in Wyoming, where he studied business administration but did not complete his degree. Despite not having a degree, Kaito had a successful career in retail management, working for a local department store chain in Cheyenne for over three decades. He started as a sales associate and rose through the ranks to become a store manager before retiring at the age of 68.\n\nKaito's annual pension and Social Security benefits amount to approximately $43,000, providing him with a comfortable living. He owns his home outright, having paid off the mortgage in 2005, and his monthly expenses are relatively low. Kaito's main economic concerns include healthcare costs and potential changes to Social Security benefits, which he heavily relies on.\n\nIn his free time, Kaito enjoys gardening, reading history books, and volunteering at the local community center, where he teaches English to immigrants. He values his independence and is proud of his self-sufficiency. Despite his advanced age, Kaito remains active in his community and keeps up with local politics, often attending city council meetings and participating in online forums discussing local issues.\n\nKaito's lack of familial responsibilities and his experience as a long-time resident of Wyoming have shaped his views on economic and political issues. He is particularly interested in policies affecting seniors, such as healthcare reform, and is skeptical of drastic changes to the Social Security system. His background in retail management also makes him keenly aware of the importance of small businesses in local economies and the challenges they face in a rapidly changing retail landscape."
