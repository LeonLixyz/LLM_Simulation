  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 49-year-old White male residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Ryan lives with his long-term partner, Emily, and their two children, Ava (12) and Ethan (9). Although they are not formally married, they have been in a committed relationship for over a decade. \n\nRyan's educational background includes two years of study at Laramie County Community College, where he pursued an associate's degree in business administration. However, due to family obligations and financial constraints, he did not complete his degree. Instead, Ryan entered the workforce, currently working as a sales representative at a local car dealership, earning an annual income of $52,000.\n\nRyan's family resides in a single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood in Cheyenne, which they own with a mortgage. The household's combined income is around $80,000 per year, with Emily working part-time as a nurse. Their primary concerns include saving for their children's education, paying off the mortgage, and affording healthcare.\n\nAs a Wyoming native, Ryan is proud of his community and is concerned about the local economy, particularly the impact of fluctuations in the energy industry on the state's job market. He values affordable healthcare, quality education, and job security, which often influence his political views. Ryan's economic priorities include lower taxes, reduced government spending, and support for small businesses."
