  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 78-year-old male who has been married to his wife, Maria, for 53 years. They reside in a cozy, single-family home in the outskirts of Casper, Wyoming, which they own outright after paying off their mortgage in 2005. Juan is of Mexican-American descent, born in New Mexico to a family that moved frequently during his childhood due to his father's work as a ranch hand. This exposure to different parts of the country eventually led Juan to settle in Wyoming, drawn by its wide open spaces and job opportunities in the energy sector.\n\nJuan is a high school graduate with an Associate's degree in Mechanical Technology, earned through a community college program in the 1960s. He leveraged this education into a successful career as a maintenance supervisor at a local oil refinery, where he worked for 35 years before retiring in 2008. His annual pension, combined with Social Security benefits and income from a modest investment portfolio, provides a comfortable retirement income of around $55,000 per year.\n\nJuan and Maria have no children, a decision they made early in their marriage due to financial concerns and a desire for freedom to travel. However, they are close to their nieces and nephews, who live in other parts of the country. Juan's health is generally good, though he manages hypertension and has undergone a hip replacement surgery a few years ago. Maria, 76, is also in good health but deals with arthritis, which has limited their travel in recent years.\n\nTheir home, valued at approximately $220,000, is in a quiet neighborhood with a mix of retirees and young families. The neighborhood has seen some decline in recent years due to the local economic downturn in the energy sector, but Juan and Maria are committed to their community and have chosen to stay.\n\nJuan is concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the impact of inflation on their fixed income. He also worries about the local economy, particularly the decline of traditional industries and the lack of job opportunities for younger people. These concerns influence his political views, making him skeptical of policies that he perceives as threatening to his economic security or the stability of his community. Despite these concerns, Juan remains optimistic about the future, valuing the freedom and opportunities that America has provided him and his family."
