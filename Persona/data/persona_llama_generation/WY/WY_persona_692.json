  "PERSONA": "Meet John Wilson, a 49-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Sarah, who is the primary household earner, working as a school principal. John's household relationship as the spouse of the householder reflects his role in supporting Sarah's career while also pursuing his own professional endeavors. Assuming a typical household type based on his marital status and household relationship, John lives in a married-couple family household with no children under the age of 18, as is common for couples in their late 40s.\n\nJohn is a high school graduate, having completed his diploma from a public high school in his birth state of Montana before moving to Wyoming for his wife's job. He speaks English fluently and has no known ethnicity. Given his birth in a different state, John has experienced some level of geographic mobility, which might influence his views on community and local economic development.\n\nJohn works as a mechanic at a local automotive repair shop, earning around $45,000 per year. He is proud of his work, which allows him to contribute to the household income and maintain a comfortable lifestyle. The couple rents a modest three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, with a monthly rent of $1,200. They have been renting for about five years, as they are saving up for a down payment on a house.\n\nJohn's economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and saving for retirement. He is keenly aware of the local economy's reliance on the energy industry and worries about the impact of economic downturns on his job and the community. As a result, John is likely to support policies that promote economic diversification and workforce development in Wyoming.\n\nIn terms of political views, John tends to lean conservative on issues related to taxes and government spending but is more liberal on social issues, such as access to affordable healthcare and education. His wife's profession in education has influenced his views on the importance of public schools and the need for adequate funding. John's experiences as a mechanic have also made him sympathetic to labor unions and workers' rights.\n\nOverall, John's persona reflects the complexities of a middle-class American family, balancing economic responsibilities, personal aspirations, and community engagement in a small city with a distinct economic profile."
