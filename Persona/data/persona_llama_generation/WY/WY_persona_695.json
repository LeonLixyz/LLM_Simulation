  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 49-year-old White female living in a domestic partnership in a small town in Wyoming. Alex was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and has lived in the state her entire life. She is a non-veteran and has never been married, but she has been in a long-term committed relationship with her partner, Sarah, for over 15 years. They reside in a single-family home in a rural area outside of Jackson, Wyoming, which they purchased together in 2010 for $320,000. The couple has a mortgage of $180,000 remaining, with a monthly payment of $1,200.\n\nAlex holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained in 1998. After working various administrative roles, she landed a job as an Office Manager at a local insurance company in Jackson, earning an annual salary of $55,000. Her partner, Sarah, is a self-employed artist, and her income varies from year to year.\n\nAlex's primary language is English, which she speaks fluently. Her education and career have provided her with a stable income, but she has concerns about the rising cost of living in Jackson, particularly with regard to housing affordability and access to healthcare. As a result, Alex is interested in local politics and policy decisions that impact the community's economic development and social services.\n\nAs a homeowner and long-term resident of Wyoming, Alex is invested in the state's economic future and is likely to prioritize issues related to rural development, education, and access to healthcare. Her experience as a same-sex partner in a conservative state has also made her more aware of LGBTQ+ rights and social justice issues. Despite the challenges, Alex is proud of her Wyoming roots and is committed to contributing to the local community through volunteer work and civic engagement."
