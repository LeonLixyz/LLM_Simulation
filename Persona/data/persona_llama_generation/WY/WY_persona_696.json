  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 22-year-old white male, who is a US citizen born in Wyoming. He holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from a local community college in Casper, Wyoming. Ethan is fluent in English and speaks it well, having grown up in a monolingual English-speaking household. \n\nEthan's marital status is divorced, having been married at 19 but separating after a year due to irreconcilable differences. He currently resides in a small apartment in downtown Casper with his ex-wife, who remains the household holder due to shared property ownership. This living arrangement is a temporary measure until they finalize their divorce proceedings and split the assets.\n\nAs the spouse of the household holder, Ethan contributes to the household income through his job as a diesel mechanic at a local truck repair shop. He earns an annual salary of $45,000, which is slightly above the median household income in Casper. Despite being divorced, Ethan is still listed as a spouse due to the shared living arrangement and joint property ownership.\n\nEthan's educational background has played a significant role in shaping his career. He chose to pursue an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology to capitalize on the high demand for skilled mechanics in Wyoming's trucking industry. His degree has enabled him to secure a well-paying job, but he aspires to start his own repair shop in the future.\n\nEthan's economic concerns revolve around saving for a down payment on a house, paying off his share of the marital debt, and building an emergency fund. He is keenly interested in local economic policies that support small businesses and promote job growth in the manufacturing sector. As a resident of Wyoming, Ethan is also concerned about the state's reliance on the fossil fuel industry and the potential economic implications of transitioning to renewable energy sources."
