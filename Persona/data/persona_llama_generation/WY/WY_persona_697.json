  "PERSONA": "John, a 68-year-old white male, has lived in a modest single-family home in a rural area of Casper, Wyoming, for the past 15 years. As the primary householder, he has grown accustomed to living alone, having never married. Born in Oklahoma, John moved to Wyoming for work opportunities after completing some college credits in business administration but not obtaining a degree. He speaks English fluently and has no known ethnic affiliations.\n\nJohn works as a part-time sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, earning approximately $32,000 per year. His income is supplemented by a small pension from his previous job as a maintenance worker at a nearby oil refinery, where he worked for nearly two decades before retiring early due to health concerns. John's combined income allows him to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, but he is mindful of his expenses and prioritizes saving for potential medical bills and long-term care.\n\nAs a non-veteran and someone who has always lived in the United States, John's worldview is shaped by his experiences as a lifelong American citizen. His education and work history have provided him with a practical understanding of business and the local economy, influencing his views on economic policy and the role of government in supporting small businesses and rural communities.\n\nJohn's primary economic concerns include access to affordable healthcare, the rising cost of living in his area, and the impact of tourism on local infrastructure. As a homeowner, he is also interested in property tax reform and initiatives that promote sustainable land use in Wyoming. Politically, John tends to identify as an independent, often voting for candidates who prioritize fiscal responsibility, environmental conservation, and support for local businesses."
