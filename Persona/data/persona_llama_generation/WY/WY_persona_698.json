  "PERSONA": "Meet Emily Wilson, a 68-year-old White female living in a single-family home in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of her residence, a modest three-bedroom house she owns, valued at approximately $230,000, with a mortgage of around $800 monthly. As a widow, Emily lives alone, having lost her husband five years ago to a long battle with cancer. They had no children together, a choice they made early in their marriage to focus on their careers and travel.\n\nEmily was born in Arizona but has lived in Wyoming for over three decades. She holds a US citizenship by birth and speaks English fluently, with no other languages spoken at home. She did not serve in the military and identifies as a non-veteran.\n\nEducationally, Emily attended Casper College, where she pursued an associate's degree in business administration but did not graduate, choosing instead to enter the workforce early to support her family. She worked as an administrative assistant at a local insurance firm for 25 years before retiring at the age of 62. Her annual retirement income is approximately $43,000, supplemented by a modest pension from her late husband's employment.\n\nEmily's economic concerns include maintaining her independence, managing her retirement savings to cover potential long-term care needs, and ensuring her home remains affordable. She is keenly interested in local and national policies affecting healthcare, particularly those impacting seniors and retirees, as well as housing policies that could influence property taxes and the cost of living in her area.\n\nGiven her experience as a widow and retiree, Emily is likely to prioritize economic security, access to quality, affordable healthcare, and policies that support seniors in maintaining their independence. Her political views are shaped by her personal experiences, the economic realities of living on a fixed income, and a desire to protect the quality of life she has worked hard to achieve."
