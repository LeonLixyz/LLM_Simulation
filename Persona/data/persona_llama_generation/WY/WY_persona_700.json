  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Ethan Thompson, a White male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with his wife, Rachel, in a married-couple household without kids. As the primary householder, Ethan takes pride in providing a comfortable life for his family. Born in Denver, Colorado, Ethan grew up in a middle-class family and moved to Wyoming for his job. He is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently.\n\nEthan holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he earned after completing his undergraduate studies in the same field. His graduate degree has been instrumental in securing his current position as an Environmental Consultant at a private firm specializing in sustainable development projects. With an annual income of $82,000, Ethan contributes significantly to the household income, while his wife, Rachel, works part-time as a librarian, earning around $30,000 per year.\n\nThe couple resides in a cozy, two-bedroom house in the historic district of Cheyenne, which they purchased for $280,000 three years ago. Their mortgage payments and utility bills account for a significant portion of their monthly expenses. Ethan is keenly aware of the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing property taxes and healthcare expenses, which have become a concern for him.\n\nEthan and Rachel enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors in their free time, often visiting the nearby Vedauwoo Recreation Area. They also participate in local community events, such as the Cheyenne Frontier Days, and are members of the Cheyenne Botanic Gardens. Ethan's economic concerns revolve around maintaining a stable income, managing household expenses, and planning for retirement, while also ensuring they can continue to enjoy their outdoor hobbies and community activities.\n\nAs a homeowner and a professional in the environmental sector, Ethan is likely to prioritize policies that promote sustainable development, affordable housing, and accessible healthcare. His experiences as a Wyoming resident have also made him aware of the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental conservation, which may influence his views on state and national policies."
