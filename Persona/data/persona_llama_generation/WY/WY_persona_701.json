  "PERSONA": "Meet 49-year-old Karen Thompson, a white, non-Hispanic female living in Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder of her household, Karen has been married to her husband, Brian, for over 10 years, but they have been separated for the past year. They do not have any children together. \n\nKaren was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and has lived in the state her entire life. She speaks English fluently and holds US citizenship by birth. After completing high school, Karen attended Casper College for two years, studying business administration but did not obtain a degree. She currently works as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company, earning an annual income of $43,200.\n\nKaren rents a two-bedroom apartment in a modest neighborhood in Casper for $850 per month. She has been renting this apartment for the past five years and has no immediate plans to buy a house. Her primary economic concerns are saving for retirement, paying off her outstanding student loan debt of $12,000, and covering the increasing cost of healthcare for her aging parents.\n\nGiven her situation, Karen's economic priorities are centered around financial stability and security. She is likely to support policies that promote affordable healthcare, reduce student loan debt, and encourage local economic growth in Wyoming. As a single-income household without dependents, Karen's political views might also lean towards issues affecting working-class Americans and the challenges of living in a rural state with limited job opportunities."
