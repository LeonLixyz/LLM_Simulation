  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 38-year-old White female, born and raised in the state of Wyoming, USA. She is a non-veteran and a US citizen by birth. Emily speaks English only and is proficient in it. She holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained after completing her undergraduate studies in the same field.\n\nEmily is divorced, having been married for about five years before separating and eventually getting a divorce two years ago. She currently resides in a shared house in Laramie, Wyoming, with two non-relative housemates, all of whom work in different fields related to environmental conservation. The house is a moderately sized, two-story rental property in a suburban neighborhood close to the university, with a mix of students, young professionals, and families.\n\nEmily works as an Environmental Consultant for a private firm in Laramie, specializing in assessing and mitigating the environmental impact of infrastructure projects. Her annual income is approximately $62,000. She has been in this role for about three years, having transitioned from a research position at the university after completing her graduate studies. Emily's job requires frequent travel within the state, which she manages with the help of her housemates, who occasionally watch her cat, Luna.\n\nDespite her stable income, Emily's financial situation is somewhat strained due to her divorce and the need to pay off her student loans. She prioritizes saving for a down payment on a house and is cautious about her spending habits. Her economic concerns include the rising costs of living in Laramie, the impact of state and federal policies on her industry, and access to affordable healthcare.\n\nIn her free time, Emily volunteers for local environmental initiatives and enjoys hiking and exploring the natural beauty of Wyoming. Her educational background and professional experience have instilled in her a strong appreciation for environmental conservation and sustainability, influencing her views on economic and political issues."
