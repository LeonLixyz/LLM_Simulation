  "PERSONA": "Name: Daniela Marquez, a 29-year-old Hispanic female, born in Wyoming to parents of Mexican descent who identify as 'Other Hispanic or Latino'. She is the primary householder in a married-couple household without kids, although she has never been formally married, as she and her partner have chosen not to get married due to personal reasons. Daniela holds US citizenship by birth and speaks English fluently, having been born and raised in the United States.\n\n Daniela is a high school graduate from a local school in Casper, Wyoming, where she currently resides. After high school, she pursued a vocational training program in cosmetology, which she completed within a year. She has been working as a hairstylist at a local salon in downtown Casper for the past five years, earning a steady income of $38,500 annually.\n\n Daniela and her partner, Alex, rent a cozy two-bedroom apartment in a moderately priced neighborhood near the city center, paying $900 per month in rent. They have been together for six years and share a strong commitment to their relationship, despite not being formally married. Their decision not to get married stems from a desire for personal freedom and a preference for focusing on their careers.\n\n Daniela's economic concerns revolve around career advancement and financial stability. She hopes to one day open her own salon, which would require additional education and a significant investment. Her current income allows her to cover living expenses, but she struggles to save for long-term goals. As a result, Daniela is keenly interested in local economic policies that support small businesses and vocational training programs.\n\nGiven her situation, Daniela is likely to prioritize economic policies that promote affordable education, job training, and support for small businesses. Her experience as a renter also makes her attentive to policies related to affordable housing and rent control. As a young, working-class individual, Daniela's economic concerns and priorities are centered around achieving financial stability and career growth in a rural state with limited job opportunities."
