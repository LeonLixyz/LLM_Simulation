  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 62-year-old white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder of her married-couple household, Karen has been in a long-term, committed relationship with her partner, Rachel, despite never being formally married due to personal preference. Both Karen and Rachel are non-veterans and have chosen not to have children. Karen is a US citizen born in the state of Montana but has resided in Wyoming for over two decades.\n\nKaren's educational background includes two years of community college, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree. This educational foundation has been instrumental in her career as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Cheyenne. She earns an annual income of $43,000, which, combined with Rachel's income as a part-time librarian, provides a comfortable living.\n\nThe couple owns a modest, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, with a mortgage that is nearly paid off. Their home is valued at approximately $280,000, reflecting the relatively low cost of living in Wyoming. Karen and Rachel take pride in their home and have made significant investments in renovations, particularly in their backyard, which they use for gardening and hosting small gatherings.\n\nKaren's economic concerns are centered around retirement security, as she plans to retire within the next few years. She is keenly interested in policies that protect and strengthen Social Security, as well as healthcare options that would be affordable and accessible in her retirement. Her experiences and priorities are shaped by her moderate income level, her relationship status, and her geographic location in a state with a distinct economic landscape influenced by the energy industry and tourism.\n\nKaren's political views are influenced by her desire for economic stability and her support for social equality, particularly for the LGBTQ+ community. She is an English-speaking, US-born citizen who values the country's diversity but is also concerned about the economic implications of immigration policies on local job markets. Despite these concerns, Karen's personal life and relationships have taught her the importance of inclusivity and social justice, making her a supporter of progressive social policies.\n\nIn summary, Karen Thompson is a financially cautious, socially progressive individual whose economic and political views are shaped by her specific life circumstances, including her relationship status, educational background, career, and geographic location in Wyoming."
