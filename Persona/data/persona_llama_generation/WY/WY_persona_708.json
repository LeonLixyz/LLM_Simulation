  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old White female, living in a single-family home in the town of Jackson, Wyoming. Alex is a widow, having lost her husband three years ago in a military operation. She is a veteran herself, having served in the Army for six years before being honorably discharged. \n\nAlex is the eldest child and currently resides with her 62-year-old father, a retired high school principal, and her 60-year-old mother, a part-time librarian, in their family home. Her younger brother is away at college. Alex's marital status as a widow and her decision to live with her parents are primarily driven by her economic situation and the need for support in raising her 8-year-old son, Ethan.\n\nAlex holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming. She works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm, specializing in conservation projects and sustainable practices. Her annual income is $62,000, which, combined with her veteran's benefits and her late husband's life insurance policy, allows her to support herself and her son comfortably.\n\nAlex is fluent in English and has a strong sense of community involvement, often participating in local town hall meetings and advocating for environmental policies that protect Wyoming's natural beauty and wildlife. Her economic concerns include affordable healthcare, education, and ensuring that her son's future is secure. Given her experience as a veteran and a widow, Alex also strongly supports policies that aid veterans and their families.\n\nLiving in Jackson, Wyoming, a tourist town with a high cost of living, Alex is acutely aware of the economic challenges faced by single parents and veterans. She rents a small apartment in her parents' home for a reduced rate, allowing her to save for Ethan's education and her own future. Alex's specific economic situation and her experiences as a veteran, widow, and single mother significantly influence her political views and priorities."
