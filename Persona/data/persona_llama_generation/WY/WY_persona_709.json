  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 57-year-old white woman who has never been married and lives with her long-term partner in a two-person household in the small town of Jackson, Wyoming. Born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Alex is a lifelong resident of the state and considers herself a true Wyoming native. She holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming and has worked as a Senior Environmental Consultant for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality for the past 15 years. Her annual income is $85,000, which is slightly above the state average.\n\nAlex's partner, Rachel, is a successful artist who owns a local gallery in Jackson. They live together in a cozy, two-bedroom house on the outskirts of town, which they purchased in 2005 for $280,000. The mortgage is paid off, and they have no outstanding debts. Alex and Rachel have no children, but they have two rescue dogs and are avid outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy hiking, camping, and skiing in their free time.\n\nAlex's graduate education has served her well in her career, and she is highly respected in her field for her expertise in environmental policy and management. Her job requires her to travel occasionally to Cheyenne and other parts of the state, but she generally works from home or in the Jackson office. Alex's economic concerns center around issues of sustainable development, access to affordable healthcare, and the impact of tourism on local communities.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex is deeply invested in the state's natural resources and is active in local conservation efforts. She is a member of the Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance and volunteers regularly with the organization to protect and preserve the area's wildlife habitats and public lands. Alex's political views are generally liberal, and she is a registered Democrat, although she is not always aligned with the national party platform on issues related to energy development and land use.\n\nAssumptions made based on the provided metadata:\n\n* Marital status: Although the metadata indicates \"Never married,\" it is assumed that Alex is in a long-term, committed relationship with her partner, Rachel, as indicated by her household relationship status.\n* Household type: Based on Alex's household relationship status and the fact that she lives with her partner, it is assumed that she resides in a two-person household.\n* Ethnicity: Given the lack of information on ethnicity, it is assumed that Alex identifies as non-Hispanic white, consistent with her racial identity."
