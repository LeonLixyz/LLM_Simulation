  "PERSONA": "Alex Thompson, a 39-year-old white male living in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming. He resides with his parents in their family home, a modest, single-story ranch-style house on the outskirts of town. Alex is married to his wife, Sarah, whom he met in high school and married at 25. They do not have children due to their current financial priorities and the fact that they are focusing on establishing their careers first. Alex's wife works part-time as a waitress in a local diner.\n\nAlex works as a heavy equipment operator in a construction company, specializing in road construction projects across Wyoming. He has been in this role for over 10 years, having started as a laborer and worked his way up. His job requires him to be away from home for several days at a time, especially during peak construction seasons. His annual income is $64,000, and he has private health insurance through his employer. \n\nAlex attended Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming, but did not complete his degree in construction management due to financial constraints. Despite this, his experience and certifications have allowed him to advance in his career.\n\nAlex's primary economic concerns are saving for a down payment on a home for himself and his wife, as well as planning for the future and potentially starting a family. He is also concerned about the impact of seasonal fluctuations in the construction industry on his job security and the overall economy of Wyoming, which he believes is heavily reliant on industries like construction and tourism.\n\nIn his free time, Alex enjoys outdoor activities like hunting and fishing, which are popular in Wyoming. He is also involved in the local community through his membership in the Cody Volunteer Fire Department. Alex's political views are shaped by his experiences as a blue-collar worker and his concerns about the local economy, job security, and access to affordable healthcare."
