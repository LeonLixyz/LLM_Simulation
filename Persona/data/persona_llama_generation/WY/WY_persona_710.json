  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Jack Harris, a retired veteran living in the small town of Cody, Wyoming. Jack is a lifelong resident of Wyoming, born and raised in the state he loves for its vast open spaces and outdoor recreational opportunities. As a white male, Jack's upbringing in a predominantly white community has likely influenced his social and economic views.\n\nJack is a veteran who served in the US Army for six years, from 1975 to 1981, during the post-Vietnam era. His time in the service took him to various parts of the country and abroad, broadening his perspective on life. After being honorably discharged, Jack returned to Wyoming, where he worked as a mechanic in a local garage for over 20 years. His experience in the service and as a mechanic has given him a strong work ethic and practical problem-solving skills.\n\nJack's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied automotive repair and business management. Although he did not complete his degree, his time in college helped him develop essential skills for running a small business and working with people.\n\nCurrently, Jack lives with his 92-year-old mother in a modest, two-bedroom home on the outskirts of Cody. The house, which has been in the family for over 40 years, is mortgage-free, and Jack takes care of the property and his mother. Jack's father passed away in 2010, and he has been his mother's primary caregiver since then. Jack's living situation is comfortable, with a combined household income of around $50,000 per year, comprising his veteran's pension and his mother's social security benefits.\n\nAs a child living with his parent, Jack's economic concerns are centered around ensuring his mother's well-being and managing the household expenses. He is keenly aware of the rising costs of healthcare and the challenges of accessing quality medical services in rural areas. Jack's experiences have made him appreciate the importance of social security, veterans' benefits, and affordable healthcare. He is likely to support policies that protect and strengthen these programs.\n\nJack's never-married status and lack of children mean he does not have to worry about providing for a family, allowing him to focus on his mother's care and his own hobbies. In his free time, Jack enjoys hunting, fishing, and volunteering at the local VFW post, where he connects with fellow veterans and gives back to the community.\n\nOverall, Jack's life experiences, economic situation, and living arrangements have shaped his views on social and economic issues. As a veteran, a caregiver, and a small-town resident, Jack's concerns and priorities are likely to influence his opinions on policies related to veterans' affairs, healthcare, social security, and rural development."
