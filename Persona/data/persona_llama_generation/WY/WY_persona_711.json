  "PERSONA": "Meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Garc\u00eda, a 29-year-old Hispanic woman living in Casper, Wyoming. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Juan, who works as a mechanic in a local auto repair shop. Despite being married, Alex is listed as \"never married\" due to the fact that they had a small, intimate ceremony with only close family members and did not obtain an official marriage certificate, reflecting the couple's non-traditional approach to marriage and their desire to avoid the associated costs and paperwork.\n\nAlex and Juan reside in a two-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood near downtown Casper, where they pay $800 per month in rent. Their apartment complex offers basic amenities, including a community pool and gym. The couple shares a 2018 Honda Civic, which Juan uses to commute to work.\n\nAlex works as a part-time receptionist at a local medical clinic, earning $28,000 per year. She has some college education, having attended Casper College for two years before dropping out due to financial constraints. Her role at the clinic is demanding, but it provides her with a stable income and flexible hours, allowing her to balance work and personal responsibilities.\n\nAlex is a Wyoming native, born and raised in Casper. She speaks English fluently and has no proficiency in Spanish, despite her Hispanic heritage. Her parents, who immigrated to the United States from Mexico, encouraged her to focus on English to improve her job prospects.\n\nAs a spouse of the household, Alex manages the household finances, ensuring that they stay within their means and make timely payments on their bills. Her primary economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off Juan's student loans, and building an emergency fund. Alex is eager to continue her education and pursue a degree in business administration, but her current financial situation and work schedule make it challenging.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. She is also an avid reader and participates in a local book club. Alex's economic priorities are centered around financial stability, security, and planning for the future, reflecting her pragmatic and responsible approach to life."
