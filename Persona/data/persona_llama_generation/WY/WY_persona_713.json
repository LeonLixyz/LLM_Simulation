  "PERSONA": "A 68-year-old white female, who for the purpose of this simulation, will be named 'Karen Thompson'. Karen is a high school graduate who was born in Iowa but has lived in Wyoming for the past 20 years. She is a US citizen and speaks English fluently, having never spoken any other language at home. Karen is currently married, but her husband is away due to work, and she is the primary householder of their home in Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital city.\n\nKaren and her husband own their home, a modest 2-bedroom house in a quiet suburban neighborhood near the city center. They have no children, and Karen's primary household responsibilities involve managing the home and their finances. Karen's husband works as an engineer in the energy sector, a common industry in Wyoming, and his job often requires him to travel. As a result, Karen is often alone at home, where she spends her time gardening, volunteering at a local animal shelter, and participating in community activities.\n\nKaren's educational background as a high school graduate has influenced her career trajectory. She worked as an administrative assistant for a local business for many years before retiring at 62. Her retirement income is supplemented by her husband's salary, which places their combined household income at around $60,000 annually. This income level allows them to live comfortably in Wyoming, where the cost of living is relatively low.\n\nKaren's economic concerns are typical of her age group and demographic; she is worried about the impact of inflation on her retirement savings and the rising costs of healthcare. As a result, she is particularly interested in economic policies that protect social security and promote affordable healthcare options for seniors. Her experience as a homeowner also makes her keenly aware of property tax rates and local economic development policies that might affect her community.\n\nIn terms of political views, Karen tends to be conservative on fiscal issues, preferring lower taxes and limited government spending. However, her experiences volunteering at the animal shelter and her concerns about healthcare have also made her sympathetic to social programs that support vulnerable populations. This mix of conservative and liberal leanings is reflective of the complex political landscape in Wyoming, where voters often prioritize local issues and personal freedoms over party affiliations."
