  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 49-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the spouse of a household and has been married for over 15 years to his wife, Karen, who works as a school administrator. Ryan's household is a two-parent household with two children, aged 12 and 15, who attend the local public school.\n\nRyan was born in Wyoming and has lived in the state his entire life. He completed some college coursework in business administration at Laramie County Community College but did not obtain a degree. Despite not having a college degree, Ryan has been able to build a successful career as a manager at a local manufacturing facility, earning an annual salary of $63,000.\n\nRyan and his family rent a single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood in Cheyenne. Their monthly rent is $1,200, which is relatively affordable given the local cost of living. Ryan's economic concerns include saving for his children's college education and paying off their outstanding mortgage on their previous home, which they had to sell due to job relocation.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Ryan does not have any military background, and his language proficiency is English only. He speaks English fluently and has no difficulties communicating with others in his community.\n\nRyan's family is active in their community, and they regularly participate in local events and volunteer work. Ryan coaches his son's Little League team and is involved in the local Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). His wife, Karen, is also active in local politics and has run for a seat on the local school board.\n\nGiven Ryan's economic situation, his primary economic concerns include job security, affordable healthcare, and access to quality education for his children. He is likely to support policies that promote economic growth, improve access to affordable healthcare, and increase funding for public education."
