  "PERSONA": "Meet Margaret \"Peg\" Thompson, a 62-year-old white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her second husband, John, a 65-year-old retired mechanic, whom she met through mutual friends at a local community center five years ago. Peg is a non-relative housemate to her husband, as they maintain separate ownership of their individual properties but reside together in John's two-bedroom house near downtown Cheyenne. \n\nPeg is a high school graduate, having completed her diploma at a local school in her hometown of Casper, Wyoming. After high school, she moved to Cheyenne for work opportunities and has been a resident of the city for over three decades. Her English proficiency is excellent, and she speaks only English at home.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Peg has never served in the military but is proud of her husband's service in the National Guard. She has been employed as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance firm for the past 15 years, earning approximately $35,000 per year. Her job provides her with a stable income, health insurance, and a sense of community engagement.\n\nPeg's primary economic concerns are maintaining a stable retirement income, ensuring access to quality healthcare, and preserving the value of her individual property, which she inherited from her parents. She and her husband enjoy exploring Wyoming's outdoors, participating in local events, and volunteering at a nearby animal shelter."
