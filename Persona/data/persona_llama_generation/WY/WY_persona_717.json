  "PERSONA": "John Michael Davis, a 69-year-old white male, is the primary householder of a married-couple household with kids in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Karen, and they have two grown children, Emily (25) and James (27), who are both pursuing their careers outside of Wyoming. John was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, but moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age and considers himself a true Wyomingite.\n\nJohn holds a certificate in automotive repair from a local community college but did not complete his associate's degree due to starting his own business. He is the proud owner of 'Davis's Auto Repair,' a small, family-run business that has been a staple in Cheyenne for over two decades. His wife, Karen, handles the finances and administrative tasks, while their son, James, occasionally helps out during his breaks from his job as a mechanical engineer.\n\nJohn and Karen purchased their current home, a cozy three-bedroom ranch-style house, in 1995 for $120,000. The house is now valued at around $250,000, and they have a mortgage of $80,000 with a monthly payment of $700. John's annual income from the business is approximately $65,000, supplemented by Karen's part-time job as a librarian, which adds another $25,000 to their household income. Their combined income places them in a comfortable middle-class position, allowing them to enjoy retirement hobbies like fishing and traveling within the United States.\n\nJohn's family is his top priority, and he is proud of his children's accomplishments. He is a self-described 'practical conservative' who values hard work, individual responsibility, and community involvement. He is concerned about the rising costs of living, access to quality healthcare, and the future of small businesses in Wyoming. Despite these concerns, John remains optimistic about his family's future and the economic prospects of his community."
