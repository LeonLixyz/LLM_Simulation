  "PERSONA": "Meet 49-year-old Ryan Thompson, a White male living in a rural area of Wyoming. Ryan was born in Montana but has resided in Wyoming for over two decades. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Emily, and they have two teenage children, ages 16 and 18. \n\nRyan shares a spacious, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne with his immediate family and his 72-year-old parents. His parents, who are retired, moved in with Ryan's family about five years ago after Ryan's father suffered a mild stroke. This living arrangement allows Ryan to care for his parents while also providing his children with a stable and loving home environment.\n\nRyan works as a mid-level manager at a local manufacturing plant, where he has been employed for over 15 years. He attended a community college for two years but did not complete his degree due to financial constraints. Despite this, Ryan has steadily climbed the career ladder through hard work and dedication, earning a salary of $65,000 per year.\n\nAs the primary breadwinner of his household, Ryan's economic concerns revolve around job security, affordable healthcare, and providing a stable future for his family. He is particularly concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming and the impact it may have on his family's well-being. Ryan's family owns their home, which they purchased 10 years ago for $220,000, and they have a mortgage of $150,000 remaining. They also have two vehicles, a 2015 Ford F-150 and a 2018 Honda Civic.\n\nRyan is fluent in English and has a strong sense of community involvement. He volunteers at a local youth sports organization and participates in neighborhood events. Ryan's family often spends their free time outdoors, enjoying Wyoming's natural beauty by hiking, fishing, and camping.\n\nRyan's economic priorities include affordable education for his children, access to quality healthcare, and a stable job market. He is likely to support policies that promote economic growth, improve infrastructure, and provide relief to working-class families."
