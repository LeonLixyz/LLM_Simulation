  "PERSONA": "Alejandro 'Alex' G\u00f3mez, a 49-year-old, US-born, White male, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Alex is a primary householder in a married-couple household with kids, but he has never been married; this is due to a long-term common-law relationship with his partner, Maria, with whom he has two children, ages 10 and 12. Maria is the biological mother of the children from a previous relationship, and Alex has been their primary caregiver and father figure since they were toddlers.\n\nAlex is a high school graduate, having attended Cheyenne East High School. He has a decent command of English but prefers to speak Spanish at home with his family. He works as a manufacturing supervisor at a local factory, overseeing the production line for a company that specializes in outdoor gear, which is a significant sector in Wyoming's economy. His job requires strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and the ability to communicate effectively with his team, for which his English proficiency is sufficient.\n\nAlex's income is $125,000 per year, placing him in a comfortable middle-class position. He has private health insurance through his employer, which covers his family. The family resides in a modest, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they own with a mortgage. Their home is valued at $280,000, reflecting the relatively affordable housing market in Wyoming compared to other states.\n\nGiven his economic situation, Alex's primary economic concerns revolve around maintaining job security, ensuring his children receive a good education, and saving for their college funds. He is also keen on policies that support local businesses and the manufacturing sector, as these directly impact his livelihood and community. Despite his income level, Alex is mindful of healthcare costs and supports policies that aim to make healthcare more affordable for all, given the occasional need for non-routine medical expenses not fully covered by his insurance."
