  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson is a 49-year-old White female living in the suburbs of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her high school sweetheart, John, a 52-year-old mechanical engineer who works for the local government. They have been married for 25 years and have two children: Emily, a 22-year-old recent college graduate working as an elementary school teacher, and 19-year-old Ben, a sophomore at the University of Wyoming studying environmental science.\n\nAlex was born in Denver, Colorado, but moved to Wyoming with her family at the age of 10. She considers Wyoming her home and has a deep affection for the state's natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities. After graduating from high school, Alex attended Casper College for two years, studying early childhood education, but did not complete her degree due to family and financial obligations.\n\nProfessionally, Alex has worked as a part-time administrative assistant at a local medical office for the past 15 years. She works 25 hours a week, which allows her to balance her job responsibilities with family obligations. Her annual income is around $35,000, and her husband's income as a mechanical engineer is approximately $85,000 per year. They own a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in a suburban neighborhood with a mortgage of $1,800 per month.\n\nThe Thompsons have a combined household income of around $120,000, placing them firmly in the middle class. They prioritize saving for their children's education and retirement, but also enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and skiing. Alex is fluent in English and has some proficiency in Spanish, which she learned from her grandmother who immigrated to the United States from Mexico.\n\nAlex's primary economic concerns include the rising cost of healthcare, the impact of inflation on their household budget, and the need for affordable education options for their children. She is also passionate about environmental issues, particularly the conservation of Wyoming's natural resources and public lands. As a spouse and mother, Alex's political views are shaped by her family's needs and her desire to ensure a secure future for her loved ones."
