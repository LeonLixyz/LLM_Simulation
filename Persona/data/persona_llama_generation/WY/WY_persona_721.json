  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Rodriguez, a 29-year-old, married, white female, who is the primary householder of a single-person household in Casper, Wyoming. She was born in Wyoming and identifies as a US citizen. Alex is fluent in Spanish, but also speaks English well, having grown up in a bilingual household. Her spouse, Juan, currently resides in another state for work, and they maintain a long-distance relationship.\n\nAlex has some college education, having completed two years at Casper College, where she studied business administration. However, she did not complete her degree due to financial constraints and the need to support herself. This decision has influenced her career trajectory, and she currently works as a sales associate at a local retail store, earning $32,000 per year. Her income is supplemented by her spouse's income, which is sent regularly, allowing her to make ends meet and plan for the future.\n\nAlex rents a one-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood in Casper, paying $800 per month, which is manageable given her income. Her economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off student loans, and building an emergency fund. She is keenly aware of the economic challenges faced by young adults in Wyoming, including limited job opportunities and rising housing costs.\n\nAs a result of her experiences, Alex prioritizes economic policies that address affordable housing, education, and job creation. She is particularly interested in initiatives that support small businesses and entrepreneurship, as she hopes to start her own business in the future. Alex is also passionate about issues affecting the Hispanic community, given her cultural background, and advocates for policies that promote diversity and inclusion."
