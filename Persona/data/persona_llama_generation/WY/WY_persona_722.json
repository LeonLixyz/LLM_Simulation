  "PERSONA": "Meet Harold Thompson, a 79-year-old male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As a White and Native American individual, Harold's heritage reflects the diverse history of the American West. He has never been married and currently resides with his niece and her family as an 'other relative of the householder,' contributing to household expenses and assisting with childcare for his two grandnieces, aged 8 and 10.\n\nHarold was born in Oklahoma but moved to Wyoming over 30 years ago, drawn by the state's wide open spaces and job opportunities in the energy sector. He has lived in Cheyenne for the past 15 years, residing in a suburban neighborhood with a mix of single-family homes and apartments. His niece's family owns the house, a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom property valued at around $280,000.\n\nWith some college education but no degree, Harold worked as an electrician for a local oil refinery until his retirement 10 years ago. His annual retirement income is approximately $55,000, supplemented by a small pension and Social Security benefits. Although he has some savings, Harold is mindful of his expenses, particularly with rising healthcare costs and the increasing burden of property taxes on his niece's household.\n\nHarold is a US citizen, fluent in English, and has never served in the military. His lack of military experience has not deterred his interest in veterans' issues, as his late father was a World War II veteran. Harold values his independence and contributes to the household by helping with chores, cooking meals, and driving the children to school.\n\nGiven his economic situation, Harold's primary concerns are maintaining his healthcare coverage, ensuring his niece's family remains financially stable, and preserving the value of their home. As a resident of Wyoming, Harold is also keenly aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy sector and the impact of federal policies on local industries."
