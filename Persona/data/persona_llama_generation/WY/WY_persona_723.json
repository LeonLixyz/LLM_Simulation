  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 62-year-old White female, born in the United States but in a different state from her current residence. Karen lives in Casper, Wyoming, the second-largest city in the state, which offers a mix of small-town charm and access to amenities. She is the primary householder of a single-family home in a moderate-income neighborhood, where she has resided for over 15 years. The house is valued at approximately $230,000, with a mortgage of about $1,200 per month.\n\nKaren is currently married but separated from her husband, who works as a truck driver and spends most of his time on the road. Despite the separation, they are not formally divorced due to financial and family considerations. Karen's household includes her 19-year-old son, who is a freshman in community college, and her 17-year-old daughter, a high school senior planning to attend the University of Wyoming next year.\n\nKaren's educational background includes two years of community college, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. This educational foundation, however, has been instrumental in her career as an administrative assistant at a local insurance agency, where she earns approximately $45,000 per year. Her job is stable, with benefits, but she often finds it challenging to make ends meet, particularly with the costs associated with her children's education and the mortgage.\n\nKaren's economic concerns are centered around securing her children's future, particularly their educational expenses and ensuring they have better opportunities than she did. She is also worried about her own retirement, as her current job does not offer a robust pension plan, and she fears she might have to work beyond the traditional retirement age to maintain her standard of living. These concerns influence her political views, with a strong emphasis on policies supporting affordable education, healthcare, and retirement security.\n\nGiven her situation, Karen is meticulous about her household budget, prioritizing necessities over discretionary spending. She supports local businesses and is involved in community activities, particularly those focused on education and family support. Despite the challenges, Karen is proud of her independence and her ability to provide for her family, and she looks forward to seeing her children graduate and start their own paths in life."
