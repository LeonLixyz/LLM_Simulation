  "PERSONA": "Maria Elena Hernandez, a 68-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, born in California but currently residing in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of a married-couple household with kids, having been married to her husband, Carlos, for 43 years. They have two adult children, both of whom have moved out for college and careers but maintain close ties with their parents.\n\nMaria's educational background consists of a high school diploma from a public school in California, where she grew up. After completing her education, she moved to Wyoming with her husband, who secured a job in the energy sector. Maria worked part-time as a receptionist in a local doctor's office for about 15 years before deciding to focus on raising her children full-time.\n\nThe couple owns a single-family home in a moderately priced neighborhood in Cheyenne, which they purchased 25 years ago. Their home is valued at approximately $280,000, with a mortgage of $120,000. Maria's husband, Carlos, is currently employed as a supervisor in a local oil refinery, earning around $85,000 per year. Maria, now semi-retired, earns a small income from part-time work as a Spanish language instructor at a local community center, which she enjoys as it allows her to stay engaged with her community and maintain her language skills.\n\nMaria's family is her top priority, and she spends a significant amount of time with her grandchildren, who live in nearby towns. Her economic concerns include saving for retirement, ensuring her grandchildren's education, and maintaining her family's standard of living in the face of inflation and economic uncertainty. She is particularly worried about the impact of policy changes on her family's healthcare and social security benefits. Maria follows local and national news closely, often discussing current events with her family and friends, and values education and community engagement highly."
