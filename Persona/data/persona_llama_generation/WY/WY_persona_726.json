  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 22-year-old White male, is the primary householder of his single-person household in a small rental apartment in downtown Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ethan is married but currently separated from his 21-year-old wife, who is originally from a neighboring town in Colorado, due to his work commitments. They met in high school and got married shortly after graduation. \n\nEthan is a US-born citizen, born in Oregon but moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age. He is fluent in English and has no reported proficiency in any other language. \n\nAfter completing his high school education, Ethan entered the workforce directly. He currently works as a sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, earning approximately $35,000 per year. His job requires him to interact with customers, mostly tourists and outdoor enthusiasts visiting Wyoming's national parks and forests.\n\nEthan is not a veteran and has no military background. His primary concerns are job security, affordable housing, and access to quality education for his potential future family. As a primary householder with a modest income, Ethan struggles with saving for long-term goals like homeownership and retirement. He rents his apartment for $800 per month, which is relatively affordable in Cheyenne's rental market.\n\nEthan's marital status as \"now married, except separated\" reflects his current living situation. Although separated, he remains committed to his marriage and hopes to reunite with his wife once his work commitments allow for more stability. This situation influences his views on economic policies related to affordable housing, job opportunities, and family support services.\n\nGiven his age, education level, and job title, Ethan's economic priorities revolve around financial stability, job growth opportunities, and access to affordable healthcare. He is likely to support policies that promote small businesses, outdoor recreation, and affordable housing initiatives, as these directly impact his current livelihood and future aspirations."
