His annual salary is $52,000, which allows him to maintain a modest lifestyle.\n\nAlex is fluent in English, having spoken it as his primary language since birth. He considers himself to be proficient in English, with a strong command of both written and spoken communication.\n\nAs the primary householder, Alex is responsible for managing the household expenses, which include $1,200 in monthly rent for his one-bedroom apartment, utilities, and groceries. He is not a homeowner but hopes to purchase a house in the near future.\n\nGiven his current economic situation, Alex's primary economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, managing his student loan debt of $30,000, and building an emergency fund to cover three to six months of living expenses. These financial priorities often influence his views on economic policies, particularly those related to affordable housing, student loan reform, and job security.\n\nIn his free time, Alex enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and camping, taking advantage of Wyoming's vast natural landscapes. He is also an avid reader, focusing on books related to personal finance and economics to stay informed about the latest trends and policies."
