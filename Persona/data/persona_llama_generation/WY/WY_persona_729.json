  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 28-year-old white male living with his parents in a suburban area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ethan was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and has lived there his entire life. He is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently.\n\nEthan's educational background includes two years of study at Laramie County Community College, where he pursued an associate's degree in automotive technology. However, due to financial constraints and a desire to enter the workforce sooner, he chose not to complete his degree. This decision was also influenced by the availability of well-paying jobs in the automotive industry in Cheyenne, where he could apply the skills he had already acquired.\n\nEthan works as a mechanic at a local car dealership, earning a yearly income of approximately $45,000. His job is stable, and he enjoys the hands-on nature of his work. Although he does not own a home, he contributes to the household expenses, helping his parents with mortgage payments on their modest, three-bedroom house.\n\nAs the youngest of three siblings, Ethan's family life is close-knit. His parents, both in their early sixties, are retired state employees. His two older sisters are married with children and live in nearby neighborhoods. Ethan's family often gathers for Sunday dinners and special occasions, fostering a sense of community and support.\n\nEthan's economic concerns revolve around saving for his own place and potentially starting a family in the future. He is keenly aware of the rising cost of living in Cheyenne and the need to balance his desire for independence with the benefits of living with his parents, which include shared household expenses and emotional support.\n\nAssumptions made based on the provided metadata include Ethan's ethnicity being non-Hispanic, given the null value for ethnicity and the provided racial category of White. Additionally, his household type is assumed to be a single-family home, given his parents' age and the fact that he lives with them."
