  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Maria Rodriguez, a Mexican-born, non-U.S. citizen living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Maria resides in a modest, two-bedroom apartment in a working-class neighborhood with her two children, aged 10 and 7. Although she is married, Maria is currently separated from her husband, who works in the oil fields of neighboring Utah, and visits the family periodically.\n\nMaria works as a part-time medical receptionist at a community clinic, earning approximately $28,000 per year. She has some college education, having completed two years at a community college in her hometown of Chihuahua, Mexico, before moving to the United States 12 years ago. Despite her limited English proficiency being a barrier initially, Maria has learned to speak English well, which has significantly aided her career advancement and daily interactions.\n\nAs a single mother with kids, Maria's economic concerns are centered around providing a stable and secure environment for her children. Her primary economic priorities include saving for their education and securing better job opportunities to increase her household income. Maria's current rent is $900 per month, which consumes a significant portion of her income, leaving her with limited savings and financial flexibility.\n\nMaria's experience as a non-U.S. citizen in a predominantly white, rural state like Wyoming has presented unique challenges, including limited access to social services and economic opportunities. Her lack of citizenship status also affects her ability to access certain government benefits and programs, making her more reliant on her job and personal savings.\n\nDespite these challenges, Maria is determined to create a better life for her children. She is currently taking online courses to improve her English skills and plans to pursue a degree in healthcare administration, hoping to secure a better-paying job in the future. Maria's economic concerns and experiences as a non-U.S. citizen, single mother, and part-time worker in a rural area make her an important demographic for understanding the complexities of economic and political issues in the region."
