  "PERSONA": "Meet 22-year-old Ethan Thompson, a white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Ethan is married to his high school sweetheart, Sarah, and they have a 2-year-old son, Jackson. Ethan and Sarah got married at 20, shortly after graduating from high school, and moved to Wyoming for work opportunities. \n\nEthan works as a maintenance technician at a local manufacturing plant, earning $45,000 per year. His job is stable, but he often works overtime to make ends meet and provide for his growing family. Sarah is a part-time preschool teacher, earning $25,000 per year. They rent a 3-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood for $1,200 per month, which is relatively affordable compared to other parts of the country.\n\nEthan's high school education has served him well in his technical job, but he sometimes feels the need for further education to advance in his career. However, with a young family to support, pursuing higher education is not currently feasible. Ethan's family is his top priority, and he is concerned about providing a stable future for them.\n\nAs a non-veteran, Ethan does not have military experience, but his father was in the Army, and Ethan has a deep respect for those who serve. Born in Ohio, Ethan moved to Wyoming for work and has grown to love the state's wide open spaces and outdoor recreational opportunities. He is a proud US citizen and values the American dream of hard work and self-reliance.\n\nEthan's economic concerns center around providing for his family, affording healthcare, and saving for his son's education. He is interested in policies that support working-class families, such as affordable childcare, education assistance, and job training programs. As a young family man, Ethan is eager to build a secure future for himself and his loved ones."
