  "PERSONA": "Meet Leila, a 48-year-old woman of Asian descent, born in the Philippines, and currently residing in Casper, Wyoming. She lives with her older brother, who is the household head, and has been a part of his household for the past five years. Leila has never been married and does not have any children of her own.\n\nLeila is a high school graduate, having completed her secondary education in the Philippines before moving to the United States. Although she is not a U.S. citizen, she speaks English well, which she learned through her education and interactions with English-speaking individuals in her community. Her English proficiency has been essential in navigating everyday life in the United States and in her current job as a sales associate at a local department store in downtown Casper.\n\nLeila earns an annual income of $35,000 and works approximately 30 hours per week. Her income is relatively stable, but she often finds herself managing her finances carefully to make ends meet. She shares household expenses with her brother, which helps alleviate some of the financial burdens.\n\nAs a non-citizen, Leila faces unique challenges and concerns, particularly regarding her immigration status and the potential impact on her future in the United States. Her economic concerns are centered around job security, access to affordable healthcare, and the possibility of deportation. These concerns influence her views on economic and political policies, making her more inclined to support policies that provide a pathway to citizenship, improve job opportunities, and ensure access to affordable healthcare for non-citizens.\n\nLeila's living situation in Casper, Wyoming, also plays a significant role in shaping her economic and political views. As a resident of a relatively small city with a strong sense of community, Leila values policies that support local businesses and promote economic growth in rural areas. Her experience as a foreign-born individual in a predominantly White community has also made her more aware of the importance of diversity and inclusion, leading her to support policies that promote social cohesion and address the needs of minority groups.\n\nAssumptions made based on null or missing values include:\n\n- Leila's ethnicity is assumed to be Asian, given her birthplace in Asia and her immigration status.\n- The household type is assumed to be a shared living arrangement, given Leila's status as an \"Other Relative of Householder.\""
