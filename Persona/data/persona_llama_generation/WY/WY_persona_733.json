  "PERSONA": "Maria Elena Hernandez, a 57-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, is the primary householder of her married-couple household with kids. Born in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming, Maria is a U.S. citizen who speaks English fluently. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, which she obtained from the University of Wyoming. \n\nMaria is a veteran of the U.S. Army, having served for six years as a logistics coordinator. After her military service, she transitioned into the private sector, working as a supply chain manager for a mid-sized manufacturing company in Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital city. Maria's job pays her an annual salary of $73,000, which, combined with her husband's income as a high school teacher ($55,000 annually), allows them to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nMaria has been married to her husband, Juan, for 25 years. They have two children, Emily (22) and Michael (19), both of whom are in college. Emily is studying to be a nurse, while Michael is pursuing a degree in engineering. Maria and her family reside in a two-story, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they own with a mortgage of $120,000. Their monthly mortgage payments are $900, and they pay $1,200 for property taxes annually.\n\nAs a homeowner and a mother of two college students, Maria's economic concerns include saving for her children's education, maintaining her family's current standard of living, and ensuring a stable retirement. Her experiences as a veteran and her career in logistics have instilled in her the importance of strategic planning and resource management. Maria is likely to support economic policies that prioritize education, veterans' benefits, and job creation in her local community, as these directly impact her family's well-being and her own economic security."
