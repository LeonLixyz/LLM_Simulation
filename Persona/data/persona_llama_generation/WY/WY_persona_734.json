  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is a non-veteran and a U.S. citizen born in the state of Wyoming. Ethan resides with his older brother and his brother's family in a suburban neighborhood. As the \"other relative of the householder,\" Ethan contributes financially to the household through his job as a data analyst at a mid-sized environmental consulting firm. \n\nEthan holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained after completing his undergraduate degree in Biology from the same institution. His educational background and career choices reflect his strong interest in environmental conservation and sustainability. \n\nAs a single individual who has never been married, Ethan has a relatively simple family structure, with no dependents of his own. However, living with his brother's family, which includes two children aged 8 and 10, exposes him to the challenges and expenses associated with raising a family. This experience likely shapes his views on family-oriented policies and education.\n\nEthan's annual income is around $62,000, which is slightly above the median household income in Cheyenne. He does not own a home and instead contributes to the household expenses as a renter. His economic concerns include affordable healthcare, access to quality education, and environmental protection policies that might impact his job and the local economy. \n\nEthan is fluent in English and has a strong proficiency in the language, which aids his career as a data analyst. He is well-informed about local and national politics, often engaging in discussions with his brother and other family members on various policy issues."
