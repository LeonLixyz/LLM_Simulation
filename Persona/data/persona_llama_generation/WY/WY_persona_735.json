  "PERSONA": "Meet 29-year-old Ethan Thompson, a Wyoming native living in the city of Cheyenne. He is a White male, born and raised in the United States, and identifies as a US citizen. Ethan speaks English fluently and has no known ethnic affiliation. \n\nEthan's educational background includes two years of study at Laramie County Community College, where he pursued an associate's degree in business administration but didn't complete it. This experience, however, helped him land a job as an Operations Coordinator at a small logistics firm in Cheyenne.\n\nHe shares a two-bedroom apartment with a non-relative housemate, Alex, in the downtown area of Cheyenne, with a monthly rent of $850. Ethan's annual salary is $42,500, which he earns working 40 hours a week at the logistics firm. He has been married to his wife, Sarah, for three years, and they have no children together. Sarah works part-time as a nurse at Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, earning $28,000 annually.\n\nEthan and his wife do not own a home but are planning to purchase one in the next two years. They currently save around $500 each month for a down payment. Ethan's primary economic concerns include saving for a home, paying off his student loans, and planning for his future family. He is particularly interested in local economic policies that could help young couples like himself and Sarah achieve homeownership and financial stability."
