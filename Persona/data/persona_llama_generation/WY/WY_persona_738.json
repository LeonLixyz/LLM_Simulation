  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 28-year-old White female, born in Oregon but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her husband, John, a 30-year-old software engineer, and they live together in a two-bedroom apartment in the downtown area of Cheyenne. They rent their home for $1,100 per month, which is relatively affordable given the local cost of living.\n\nAlex holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2019. She works as a Sustainability Coordinator for the City of Cheyenne, earning a salary of $55,000 per year. Her job involves developing and implementing environmentally friendly initiatives and policies for the city.\n\nAs a spouse of the household, Alex's economic situation is relatively stable, with a combined household income of $90,000 per year. However, they do have some student loan debt from their graduate programs, totaling around $60,000, which they are actively paying off. They also have a savings goal to purchase a home in the next two to three years, which motivates them to maintain a relatively frugal lifestyle.\n\nAlex's educational background has had a significant impact on her career trajectory. Her graduate degree has opened up opportunities for her in the field of environmental science, and she feels fortunate to be working in a role that aligns with her values. However, she is aware of the limited job opportunities in her field in Wyoming and is considering pursuing a Ph.D. in the future to increase her career prospects.\n\nAlex and her husband do not have any children, but they are planning to start a family in the next few years. They are concerned about the quality of education and healthcare in Wyoming, particularly in rural areas, and are considering these factors in their decision-making process.\n\nGeographically, Cheyenne is a relatively small city, and Alex appreciates its close-knit community and outdoor recreational opportunities. However, she is also aware of the challenges faced by the city, including a relatively low median income and limited job opportunities in certain sectors. These concerns inform her economic priorities, which include increasing access to affordable education and job training programs, as well as promoting sustainable economic development in the region.\n\nIn terms of economic concerns, Alex is particularly worried about the impact of climate change on Wyoming's economy, particularly in the agriculture and tourism sectors. She is also concerned about the state's reliance on fossil fuels and the need to diversify its energy portfolio. These concerns influence her views on economic policy, and she is likely to support initiatives that promote sustainable development, renewable energy, and environmental protection."
