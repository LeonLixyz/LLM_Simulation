  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 28-year-old White male, born and raised in the state of Wyoming, specifically in the city of Casper, where he currently resides with his parents in a suburban neighborhood. He has never been married and has no children. Ethan is a US citizen, born in Wyoming, and speaks English fluently, having only ever spoken English at home. He has a high school diploma from Natrona County High School, where he graduated in 2013. After high school, Ethan entered the workforce directly, eschewing college due to the high cost and the immediate job opportunities available in the energy sector in Wyoming.\n\nEthan works as a Heavy Equipment Operator in the mining industry, a job that requires him to travel occasionally within the state but primarily keeps him in Casper. He has been employed by the same company, a mid-sized mining operation, for about five years now, working his way up from an entry-level position due to his aptitude with machinery and strong work ethic. His income is approximately $175,000 annually, placing him in a relatively high-income bracket for his age group and location. This income allows him to contribute to the household income, supporting his parents, who are nearing retirement age, and also save for his own future.\n\nDespite his high income, Ethan's living situation is modest. He resides with his parents to help with household expenses, including the mortgage on their family home, which they've owned for over two decades. Ethan's decision to stay at home also reflects his conservative approach to finances; he prioritizes saving and investing over immediate personal luxuries. His health insurance is provided through his employer, a comprehensive private plan that covers most of his medical needs.\n\nGiven his occupation and the economic realities of Wyoming, Ethan is deeply concerned about the stability of the energy sector and its impact on local employment. He is keenly aware of the fluctuations in the market and the challenges faced by smaller mining operations. Consequently, he supports policies that promote energy independence and job security in the sector. His economic concerns extend to the broader implications of national economic policies on local industries and the cost of living, particularly in regions like Wyoming that are heavily reliant on natural resources.\n\nEthan's educational background and career path have also shaped his views on education and job training. He believes in the importance of vocational training and apprenticeships, especially for those who, like him, choose not to pursue higher education. He advocates for policies that support vocational schools and on-the-job training programs, seeing them as vital for the workforce in industries like his.\n\nLiving in a conservative state like Wyoming, Ethan's political views are influenced by the local culture and economy. He values self-reliance and limited government intervention in personal and business affairs, reflecting the libertarian leanings common in the region. However, his experience working in a heavily regulated industry also makes him pragmatic about the role of government in ensuring safety standards and fair labor practices.\n\nOverall, Ethan's persona is that of a practical, hardworking individual deeply rooted in his community and conscious of the economic realities that shape his life and the lives of those around him. His views on economic and political issues are informed by his experiences and the specific challenges and opportunities of living and working in Wyoming."
