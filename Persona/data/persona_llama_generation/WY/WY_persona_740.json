  "PERSONA": "Meet Evelyn Thompson, a 68-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming. She resides with her 90-year-old mother in a single-family home they've owned for over 20 years. Evelyn is married to her high school sweetheart, John, who she met in her hometown in Oregon, where she was born and raised. They relocated to Wyoming 15 years ago to be closer to their grandchildren. John, 70, works part-time as a retired mechanic, supplementing their income with occasional odd jobs.\n\nEvelyn is a non-veteran and has not been part of the labor force for the past five years. Prior to that, she worked as an administrative assistant for a local doctor's office for over a decade. She attended Casper College but did not complete her degree, instead focusing on raising her two children and supporting her family. Evelyn's educational background has provided her with basic computer skills and organizational abilities, which she uses to manage the household and volunteer at a local animal shelter.\n\nEvelyn's household income is approximately $55,000 per year, comprised of John's part-time income, their combined social security benefits, and a small pension from Evelyn's previous employer. They own their home, which is valued at around $250,000, and have a modest mortgage payment. Evelyn's primary economic concerns include affording healthcare for her aging mother, managing their retirement savings, and maintaining their current standard of living.\n\nAs a lifelong English speaker, Evelyn is fluent and articulate, often participating in local community discussions and town hall meetings. Her concerns about the economy and politics are centered around healthcare reform, social security, and issues affecting seniors and retirees. Given her experience as a caregiver for her mother, Evelyn is particularly invested in policies related to elder care and support services."
