  "PERSONA": "Meet Margaret \"Meg\" Thompson, a 68-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is a US-born citizen, born to American parents while they were temporarily residing in the US Virgin Islands. Meg is married to her high school sweetheart, John, and they have been together for 45 years. They have two children who have long since moved out to start their own families, leaving Meg and John to live with their youngest son, Alex, who is 30 years old and currently between jobs. \n\nMeg is a high school graduate and has not pursued any further formal education. She spent most of her working years as a part-time librarian at the local elementary school but has been retired for about 5 years. Her husband, John, is a 70-year-old retired mechanic who still works on cars as a hobby. Their combined annual household income is around $55,000, mostly from John's pension and their social security benefits.\n\nThe Thompsons own a single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood in Casper, which they purchased in 1985 for $120,000. Their current home value is around $280,000, and they have about $120,000 left on their mortgage. Meg's economic concerns include the rising cost of living, especially healthcare costs, and the uncertainty of social security benefits for her and her husband. She is also worried about her son Alex's unemployment and the impact it has on their household income.\n\nMeg's daily life revolves around her family and community. She spends most of her time gardening, volunteering at the local library, and helping with her grandchildren. She is fluent in English and has no known language barriers. As a retired resident of Wyoming, Meg's economic and political views are shaped by her experiences as a homemaker, a part-time worker, and a concerned citizen."
