He is married to his 23-year-old wife, who is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Environmental Science at the University of Wyoming.

After graduating, he decided to take a break from his career to support his wife's educational pursuits and raise their child. Ethan's wife is expected to graduate in 2025, after which Ethan plans to re-enter the workforce, possibly in a management role in the private sector.\n\nThe family of three lives in a cozy, rented apartment in a family-friendly neighborhood near the university. Their monthly rent is $1,200, which is covered by Ethan's wife's graduate assistantship stipend and some savings they accumulated before Emma's birth. Ethan is responsible for managing the household budget, ensuring they stay within their means, and making smart financial decisions to secure their future.\n\nEthan is a US citizen, born and raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He speaks English fluently and has no known disabilities. His family does not rely on any government assistance programs, but they do benefit from the university's childcare services, which are subsidized for graduate students.\n\nGiven their current situation, Ethan's primary economic concerns are saving for Emma's education, building an emergency fund, and planning for their future homeownership. He is keenly interested in local and national policies affecting education, childcare, and economic development, as these issues directly impact his family's well-being and future prospects."
