  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 49-year-old married woman living in the suburban town of Casper, Wyoming, with her husband and his family. She is of mixed White and Native American descent, with her mother's side tracing back to the Shoshone tribe native to the region. Born in Billings, Montana, Alex moved to Wyoming for her husband's job as a mining engineer. \n\nAlex holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, where she met her husband, John. Before leaving the workforce, she worked as an environmental consultant for five years, focusing on sustainable practices in the mining industry. She left her job to care for her husband's elderly mother, who suffers from dementia and lives with them. This role has become a full-time responsibility, making Alex's labor force status \"Not in Labor Force.\"\n\nThe family resides in a spacious, single-story home on the outskirts of Casper, which they inherited from John's parents. The house is fully paid off, allowing them to live relatively comfortably on John's income alone. Their household income is around $95,000 per year, with Alex's husband working as a senior engineer at a local mine.\n\nAlex's primary concerns revolve around healthcare and social services for the elderly, given her experiences caring for her mother-in-law. She is also passionate about environmental issues, often volunteering for local clean-up initiatives and advocating for more sustainable practices in Wyoming's extractive industries. Despite not being in the labor force, Alex remains engaged in her community, using her skills to support local causes and her family.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex is well aware of the state's reliance on the mining industry and the challenges it poses to the environment. Her economic concerns include the potential impact of environmental regulations on her husband's job and the local economy, as well as ensuring that the state's natural beauty is preserved for future generations."
