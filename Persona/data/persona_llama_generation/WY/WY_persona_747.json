  "PERSONA": "Juan Carlos Ramirez, a 57-year-old Mexican-American male, lives in a household with his parents in Casper, Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Elena, whom he met while working in the oil fields. They do not have any children together but have been considering adoption.\n\nJuan Carlos holds an Associate's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Casper College, which he obtained after moving to Wyoming from Texas, his birthplace. His proficiency in English, which he speaks well, has been beneficial in his career as a Maintenance Supervisor at a local oil refinery. He has been employed there for over a decade and earns approximately $73,000 annually. \n\nJuan Carlos and his wife rent a cozy two-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood near downtown Casper, paying $900 per month. They have been saving up to buy a house but have not yet found the right opportunity. Juan Carlos's economic concerns revolve around job security, healthcare costs, and the rising cost of living in Wyoming. His family's economic situation is relatively stable, but he worries about the future of the oil industry and its impact on his job.\n\nAs a member of the local community, Juan Carlos is active in the Casper Mexican-American community and often participates in cultural events. His family's cultural heritage is essential to him, and he makes sure to pass it down to his nieces and nephews, who live in Texas. Juan Carlos's wife, Elena, works part-time as a nurse, and they both value education, hoping to one day start a scholarship fund for underprivileged students in their community.\n\nJuan Carlos's parents, who live with him, are retired and receive Social Security benefits. His father, a former farmworker, and his mother, a homemaker, moved to Wyoming to be closer to Juan Carlos and Elena. They contribute to the household income by helping with groceries and household expenses.\n\nAssumption: Given Juan Carlos's household relationship as a \"Child living with Parents,\" it is assumed that his parents are elderly and require some level of care, which Juan Carlos and his wife provide."
