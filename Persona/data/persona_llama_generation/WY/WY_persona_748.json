  "PERSONA": "Meet Wanona \"Noni\" Little Deer, a 68-year-old American Indian and Alaska Native woman, specifically of the Northern Arapaho tribe, residing in Riverton, Wyoming, with her husband, Wayne, a retired school teacher. She lives in a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home that they own in a suburban neighborhood near the Wind River Indian Reservation.\n\nNoni holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in 1979. She has been working as an Environmental Consultant for the past 20 years, specializing in tribal environmental programs. Her current job is with a private consulting firm that works closely with the Wind River Indian Reservation, focusing on water quality management and conservation efforts. Noni's annual income is $62,000, and she is proud of the work she does, which allows her to contribute to her community's environmental well-being.\n\nNoni was born in Montana but moved to Wyoming with her family at a young age. She met her husband in college, and they have been married for 40 years. Although their children are grown and live elsewhere, they have two grandchildren who live with them, as their daughter is currently pursuing her master's degree in a different state. Noni's household is multigenerational, with her 90-year-old mother also living with them.\n\nAs a homeowner, Noni is concerned about property taxes and the rising costs of living in Wyoming. She is also passionate about environmental conservation and the impact of climate change on her community. Her economic priorities include affordable healthcare, especially for seniors and those living in rural areas, and preserving tribal lands and resources. Noni is fluent in English and has a strong command of the language, which has been essential in her career.\n\nNoni's experience as a tribal member and her work with environmental programs have shaped her economic and political views. She is a strong advocate for tribal sovereignty and self-determination, particularly in matters related to land use and natural resource management. She believes in investing in renewable energy sources and reducing the state's reliance on fossil fuels. Noni is also concerned about the lack of job opportunities in rural Wyoming and supports initiatives that promote economic development and diversification in the region.\n\nAs a voter, Noni is likely to support candidates who prioritize environmental conservation, tribal rights, and economic development in rural areas. Her unique blend of professional experience, cultural background, and personal circumstances makes her a valuable voice in Wyoming's policy discussions."
