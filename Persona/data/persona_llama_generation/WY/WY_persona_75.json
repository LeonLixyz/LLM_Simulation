  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old White female, married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan, and living with her parents in a small suburban town in Casper, Wyoming. She was born in Oregon but moved to Wyoming with her family at the age of 10. Alex graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Marketing from the University of Wyoming and has been working as a Sales Representative for a local outdoor gear store for the past five years. Her annual income is $42,500, and she has private health insurance through her employer. Alex and her husband are saving to buy their own home, currently renting the basement of her parents' house for $800 per month, which includes utilities. They have no children but are planning to start a family soon.\n\nAlex's parents, both in their early sixties, are retired school teachers who own their home outright, having paid off the mortgage several years ago. They are supportive of Alex and Ryan's plans for the future and are helping them with their savings goals. Alex's marriage has been a stabilizing factor in her life, and she values the financial security that comes with it. She and Ryan enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and camping, which is why she loves her job at the outdoor gear store.\n\nAlex's economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, managing her student loan debt of $20,000, and building a stable financial future for her soon-to-be family. She is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to affordable housing, education, and access to outdoor recreational spaces. Alex is a moderate voter who prioritizes practical solutions over party affiliations. She is active in her community, volunteering at local environmental events and participating in town hall meetings to stay informed about issues affecting her community."
