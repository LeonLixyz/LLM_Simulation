  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Robert \"Rob\" Thompson, a US-born citizen who has lived in Wyoming his entire life. He resides in the small town of Jackson, nestled in the heart of the Teton County, where he grew up with his parents, who are now in their early nineties. Rob still lives with his parents, taking on a caregiver role as they navigate their advanced age. This living arrangement is partly due to Rob's decision to prioritize family and partly due to the economic benefits it provides, such as shared living expenses.\n\nRob holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science, which he obtained from the University of Wyoming in 1978. After graduating, he worked as a park ranger for over 30 years, primarily in Grand Teton National Park. He chose to retire early, at the age of 62, due to the physical demands of the job and the desire to focus on his family. His experience in the park service has given him a strong appreciation for conservation and the outdoors, influencing his views on environmental policies.\n\nAs a non-veteran and having never been married, Rob's perspective on economic and political issues is shaped by his experiences as a public servant, a son, and a member of a close-knit community. His annual income is approximately $40,000, which comes from his retirement pension and some investment income from his parents' estate. He is not currently in the labor force but remains engaged in his community through volunteer work at local conservation organizations.\n\nRob's economic concerns are centered around the affordability of healthcare for his aging parents and the impact of tourism on the local environment. He is keenly interested in policies that support the preservation of Wyoming's natural beauty and those that address the rising costs of living, especially for seniors. Despite the challenges, Rob feels a deep connection to his community and is proud to call Jackson home.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- Rob's annual income is based on the average retirement income for a park ranger in Wyoming.\n- His decision to live with his parents is influenced by both familial and economic factors.\n- His involvement in local conservation efforts reflects his professional background and personal interests."
