  "PERSONA": "Kevin Thompson is a 38-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital and most populous city of the state. He is the primary householder in a married-couple household without kids, having been married to his wife, Rachel, for 8 years. Kevin is a non-veteran, born in the United States in the state of Montana, but has resided in Wyoming for the past 10 years.\n\nKevin holds a high school diploma and attended Casper College for two years, studying business administration, but did not obtain a degree. He is currently employed full-time as a Sales Representative at a local hardware store, earning an annual income of $52,000. His job involves frequent interactions with customers, providing advice on hardware and home improvement products.\n\nKevin and his wife rent a two-bedroom apartment in a mixed residential neighborhood in downtown Cheyenne, paying $850 per month in rent. The couple does not have any children, allowing them to allocate a significant portion of their income towards savings, with the long-term goal of purchasing a house.\n\nKevin's primary economic concern is the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly the increasing housing costs and property taxes. As a sales representative, he is also concerned about the impact of e-commerce on local businesses and the potential for job insecurity in the retail sector. Despite these concerns, Kevin feels relatively stable in his job and is optimistic about the local economy, citing the growth of the energy industry in Wyoming and its positive effects on the state's economy.\n\nKevin's educational background and career trajectory have influenced his views on education and job training programs. He believes in the importance of vocational training and apprenticeships, as he has seen firsthand the value of hands-on experience in his own career. Kevin is also a strong supporter of local businesses and believes that policies should prioritize supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nIn his free time, Kevin enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. He is also an avid reader, particularly interested in history and politics, which often sparks discussions with his wife and friends about current events and policy issues."
