  "PERSONA": "Alexandr \"Alex\" Petrenko, a 29-year-old white male, born in Wyoming to parents of Eastern European descent, specifically Ukrainian. He is married to his 27-year-old wife, Sofia, whom he met in graduate school. They currently reside with his parents in a suburban area of Cheyenne, Wyoming, due to financial constraints and the desire to save for a down payment on their own home.\n\nAlex's parents, both in their late 50s, are naturalized US citizens who immigrated to the United States in their mid-20s. His father works as an engineer, and his mother is a part-time accountant. Alex's family speaks Ukrainian at home, but he and his wife primarily communicate in English, which he speaks proficiently but with a noticeable accent. He often uses Ukrainian with his parents, especially when discussing family matters or cultural traditions.\n\nAlex holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 2020. His graduate education was partly funded by scholarships and part-time research assistantships. He currently works as an Environmental Consultant for a local firm, earning an annual salary of $62,000. His job involves conducting environmental impact assessments and developing sustainability plans for various projects in the region.\n\nAlex and his wife, Sofia, are expecting their first child, and they are eager to move into their own home. However, the high cost of living in Cheyenne and the competitive housing market have forced them to delay their plans. They are currently exploring options for first-time homebuyers and seeking financial assistance programs.\n\nAs a result of his family situation and financial priorities, Alex is deeply concerned about affordable housing, access to quality education, and job security. He is also passionate about environmental issues, particularly those affecting his home state of Wyoming, such as land conservation and responsible resource management. Alex's economic views are centered around promoting sustainable development, supporting local businesses, and addressing the challenges faced by young families in rural areas."
