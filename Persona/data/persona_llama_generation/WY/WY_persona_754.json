  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 29-year-old white female, born and raised in Wyoming, specifically in the city of Cheyenne, the state capital. She is married but currently separated from her husband, whom she met in graduate school. Emily holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2020. \n\nDespite her educational achievements, Emily is currently unemployed, having lost her job as a Sustainability Consultant at a local non-profit organization due to funding cuts in March 2023. Prior to her job loss, she was actively involved in local environmental initiatives, working closely with community groups and state agencies. Her experience in the labor force and her education background have equipped her with a strong understanding of environmental policy and its economic implications.\n\nEmily lives with two housemates in a shared rental property in downtown Cheyenne, a relatively affordable option compared to homeownership in the area. Her monthly rent is $800, a significant portion of her unemployment benefits. She is fluent in English and has no known language barriers.\n\nGiven her current situation, Emily's primary economic concerns include finding stable employment that aligns with her educational background and experience, managing her financial responsibilities, including her rent and outstanding student loans, and navigating the complexities of the healthcare system as an unemployed individual. Her marital status and living situation also influence her views on family support systems and social services.\n\nEmily's experience as an environmental professional and her involvement in community initiatives have shaped her political views, prioritizing policies that support sustainable development, job creation in the green sector, and accessible education and training programs for workers transitioning to new industries."
