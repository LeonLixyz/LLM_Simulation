  "PERSONA": "Ana Garc\u00eda is a 79-year-old retired woman living in a suburban area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but has been a US citizen for over 40 years, having moved to the United States with her husband, John, for his job as an engineer in the oil industry. Ana speaks English fluently, having learned it as a child in a bilingual school in Argentina and further honing her skills after moving to the US.\n\nAna and John have been married for 52 years and have two adult children, both of whom have moved out of the state for work. Their son works as a financial analyst in Denver, Colorado, and their daughter is a doctor in Seattle, Washington. Ana's household consists of just her and her husband, living in a modest, two-bedroom house they purchased in the 1980s.\n\nAna attended a community college for two years, studying early childhood education, but did not complete her degree due to family responsibilities. She worked part-time as a preschool teacher's assistant for several years before deciding to focus on raising her children full-time. Her husband, John, is now 82 and retired, having worked for over 30 years in the oil industry. They rely on his pension, social security, and some investments for their income, which is approximately $60,000 per year.\n\nAna's primary concerns are healthcare and the rising costs of living, particularly as they relate to her and her husband's age and potential long-term care needs. She is also interested in local issues, such as the development of the city and the impact of tourism on the community. As a retiree, Ana has more time to engage in her hobbies, including gardening, reading, and volunteering at a local animal shelter. She and her husband enjoy taking short road trips to visit their children and explore the region."
