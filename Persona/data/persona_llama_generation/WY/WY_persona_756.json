  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 49-year-old White female, is a Wyoming native who currently resides with her parents in a single-family home in the suburban town of Casper. She is married to her husband, Michael, whom she met in college, but they are currently separated due to work commitments. Emily's husband works as an engineer in a nearby city, and they maintain a long-distance relationship. \n\nEmily has some college education, having attended Casper College for two years, where she studied business administration. However, she did not complete her degree due to financial constraints. Despite this, she has managed to secure a stable job as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance company, earning $32,000 annually. Her job requires proficiency in English, which she speaks fluently.\n\nAs a child living with her parents, Emily contributes to the household expenses, which include the mortgage for their single-family home valued at $220,000. Her parents, both in their early sixties, are semi-retired, and her father works part-time as a consultant. Emily's household income is approximately $80,000 per year, combining her income with her parents' retirement benefits and part-time earnings.\n\nEmily's family situation influences her economic priorities, with a strong focus on affordable healthcare and social security for her aging parents. As a result, she is concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on her family's financial stability. Given her experience living with her parents, Emily also values programs supporting intergenerational households and affordable housing initiatives.\n\nEmily's specific geographic location in Casper, Wyoming, also shapes her economic concerns, particularly regarding the state's reliance on the energy industry and the potential economic implications of environmental policies on local employment. Her experiences and priorities make her a unique individual within the demographic group, with a distinct perspective on economic and political issues."
