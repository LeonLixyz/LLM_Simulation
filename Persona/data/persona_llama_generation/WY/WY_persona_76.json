  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson, a 68-year-old white male, lives in the small town of Cody, Wyoming, with his 92-year-old mother, who he cares for. Harold has been married to his wife, Barbara, for 45 years, and they have two grown children who live out of state. Despite his advanced age, Harold remains employed as a part-time high school librarian, having graduated from Cody High School in 1972 and later earning his teaching certification through a community college program. He works 20 hours a week, earning $28,500 annually, which is his primary source of income.\n\nHarold's wife, Barbara, is retired and receives a small pension from her previous job as a nurse. They own their modest home, which they purchased in 1980 for $43,000, and have managed to pay off the mortgage. However, they struggle to make ends meet, and their combined income barely covers their living expenses, including Harold's mother's medical bills and their own healthcare costs, as they lack health insurance coverage.\n\nAs a result of their financial situation, Harold is deeply concerned about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing prices of healthcare and medication. He worries about their ability to afford the necessary care for his mother and himself as they age. Harold's economic priorities include access to affordable healthcare, social security benefits, and support for caregivers like himself.\n\nDespite these challenges, Harold remains optimistic about his community and is actively involved in local politics, often attending town hall meetings and voting in local elections. He values education and is proud of his role in shaping the minds of Cody's youth. Harold's experience as a caregiver and his struggles with the healthcare system have made him an advocate for policies that support seniors and their families.\n\nHarold's daily routine involves caring for his mother, working at the high school library, and enjoying the outdoors by taking short walks around Cody. He is proud of his Wyoming heritage and values the close-knit community, where neighbors look out for one another. Harold's story reflects the complexities of aging in rural America, where economic challenges and limited access to resources can significantly impact one's quality of life."
