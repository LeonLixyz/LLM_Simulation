  "PERSONA": "Meet John Taylor, a 62-year-old white male, who resides in the small town of Cody, Wyoming, with his wife, Karen, and their 16-year-old son, Alex. Born in rural Nebraska, John grew up in a farming family and moved to Wyoming 30 years ago for better job opportunities. He is a high school graduate and has served in the US Army for four years, which significantly shaped his life and career. \n\nJohn works as a maintenance supervisor at a local manufacturing plant, earning $62,000 per year. He is proud of his job and takes great care in ensuring the plant operates efficiently. His veteran status has provided him with certain benefits, including a low-interest mortgage that helped him purchase a modest three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood for $220,000. John and Karen have been married for 25 years, and their son is a junior in high school, planning to attend a local community college after graduation.\n\nAs a household primary, John takes his financial responsibilities seriously, managing the family budget and ensuring they save for Alex's education and their retirement. Their combined household income is $90,000, with Karen working part-time as a librarian at the local library. They have a mortgage of $1,500 per month and two car loans, with a total monthly payment of $800. John's economic concerns include saving for retirement, affording healthcare, and ensuring his son receives a quality education.\n\nJohn's high school education has served him well in his career, but he wishes he had pursued higher education to advance further in his field. He values hard work and is proud of his accomplishments but recognizes the challenges faced by younger generations in finding stable employment and affording education. John is an English-speaking, US-born citizen who values his community and is involved in local volunteer work, including coaching a youth baseball team and participating in town hall meetings.\n\nJohn's veteran status has instilled in him a strong sense of patriotism and responsibility, influencing his political views on national security and foreign policy. He prioritizes economic growth, affordable healthcare, and quality education, which he believes are essential for the well-being of his family and community. As a resident of Wyoming, John is also concerned about environmental issues, particularly those affecting the local wildlife and natural resources."
