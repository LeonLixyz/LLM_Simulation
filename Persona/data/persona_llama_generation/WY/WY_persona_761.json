  "PERSONA": "Meet John, a 62-year-old White male living in the scenic town of Jackson, Wyoming. Born in Colorado, John has been a US citizen his entire life. He currently resides with his parents in their family home, a modest two-story house on the outskirts of town, due to his recent retirement and decision to care for his aging parents. \n\nJohn is married, but his wife, Sarah, lives in a nearby town where she works as a part-time librarian. They have an amicable long-distance arrangement, seeing each other on weekends and taking turns visiting each other's residences. This setup suits them as they value their independence while maintaining a strong bond.\n\nJohn holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 1985. Before his retirement, he worked as an Environmental Consultant for the Wyoming State Government for over 25 years, focusing on conservation projects and policy development. His career was fulfilling, and he was respected in his field for his in-depth knowledge of Wyoming's unique ecosystems.\n\nGiven his extensive experience in the public sector, John's annual retirement income is $65,000, supplemented by a modest pension. His parents' combined Social Security benefits add to the household income, ensuring a comfortable living situation. The family owns their home outright, having paid off the mortgage years ago, which significantly reduces their living expenses.\n\nJohn's educational background and career have instilled in him a deep appreciation for environmental conservation and the importance of sustainable practices. He is concerned about the impact of climate change on local wildlife and ecosystems, often participating in town hall meetings and advocating for eco-friendly policies.\n\nAs a retiree, John's economic concerns revolve around healthcare costs, particularly ensuring his parents receive quality medical care as they age. He also worries about the rising cost of living in Jackson, which he believes may eventually price out long-time residents. John is keenly interested in local politics, especially issues related to land use, conservation, and affordable housing.\n\nIn his free time, John enjoys hiking in Grand Teton National Park and volunteering for local environmental initiatives. His economic and political views are shaped by his deep connection to Wyoming's natural beauty and his desire to preserve it for future generations."
