  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 68-year-old white female residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She was born in the same state and has lived there her entire life. Karen is married to her high school sweetheart, John, and they have been together for 46 years. Despite being empty nesters, their 42-year-old daughter, Emily, recently moved back in with them due to financial difficulties after a divorce. This living arrangement is a temporary measure until Emily gets back on her feet.\n\nKaren has some college education, having attended Laramie County Community College for two years, where she studied business administration. However, she did not complete her degree due to family obligations. She has been employed as an administrative assistant at a local insurance firm in Cheyenne for the past 20 years. Her annual income is approximately $43,000, and her husband, John, supplements their household income with his work as a retired mechanic who occasionally takes on odd jobs.\n\nThe Thompsons own a modest, three-bedroom home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they purchased in 1985 for $120,000. Their current mortgage is $800 per month, with 10 years left on their loan. They also have a 2018 Ford F-150 that John uses for his part-time work.\n\nKaren's primary economic concerns include saving for retirement, as she plans to retire in three years, and ensuring her daughter gets back on her feet financially. She is also worried about the rising cost of healthcare and the impact of inflation on their fixed income. Karen and her husband have a combined retirement savings of around $250,000, which they hope will be sufficient to maintain their current lifestyle.\n\nGiven her life experiences and economic situation, Karen tends to be fiscally conservative, prioritizing budgetary discipline and cautious spending. However, she also values social programs that support low-income families and access to affordable healthcare, having seen her daughter struggle with medical bills after her divorce."
