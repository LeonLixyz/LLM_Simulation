  "PERSONA": "Alexis \"Lexi\" Thompson, a 29-year-old White female, born in Billings, Montana, but currently residing in Casper, Wyoming. Lexi holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2018. She is a divorced woman, having been married from 2019 to 2022. Lexi is currently the spouse of her new partner, who is the household's primary income earner. Her partner works as a petroleum engineer in the oil and gas industry.\n\nLexi is employed as a Conservation Coordinator for the local county government, with a yearly income of $52,000. She works closely with local farmers, ranchers, and environmental groups to implement sustainable practices and develop conservation plans. This role aligns with her educational background and passion for environmental protection.\n\nThe couple rents a three-bedroom apartment in a mid-range neighborhood in Casper, paying $1,200 per month. They share a 2018 Toyota 4Runner for transportation and have a combined household income of around $110,000. Lexi's partner has two children from a previous marriage, who live with them part-time.\n\nLexi's economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, managing the rising costs of living in Wyoming, and addressing the impact of the oil and gas industry on the local environment. Her partner's job security and the fluctuations in the energy market also contribute to her financial worries.\n\nGiven her background in environmental science and her work in conservation, Lexi is likely to prioritize policies supporting sustainable practices, renewable energy, and environmental protection. Her experience as a renter and her desire for homeownership may also influence her views on housing policies and affordable living."
