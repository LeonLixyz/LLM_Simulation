  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 22-year-old white male, resides with his parents in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Despite being divorced, which is unusual for his age, Ethan's marital status is a result of a brief, early marriage that ended amicably due to irreconcilable differences. He was born in Oregon but has lived in Wyoming for the past 10 years, allowing him to claim it as his home state.\n\nEthan holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, which he obtained from the University of Wyoming. However, he is currently not in the labor force, focusing on personal projects and considering further education or career development opportunities. His parents, both in their late 40s, are supportive of his decisions and provide him with a stable living environment.\n\nEthan's family household is upper-middle-class, with his father working as a manager in the energy sector and his mother as a part-time teacher. They own a spacious, three-bedroom house in a safe and quiet neighborhood, with Ethan occupying one of the bedrooms. This living arrangement allows him to save money and allocate his resources to personal interests and potential future educational pursuits.\n\nEthan is fluent in English, having spoken it as his primary language throughout his life. His education has equipped him with strong analytical skills, and he is interested in exploring career paths related to business or finance. Despite his current non-participation in the labor force, Ethan is aware of the importance of economic stability and is likely to prioritize job security and opportunities for professional growth when he decides to enter the workforce.\n\nGiven his age, educational background, and current living situation, Ethan's economic concerns revolve around finding a stable and fulfilling career, managing his finances effectively, and making smart decisions about further education or training. He is likely to support policies that promote job creation, education, and economic growth, particularly in his home state of Wyoming."
