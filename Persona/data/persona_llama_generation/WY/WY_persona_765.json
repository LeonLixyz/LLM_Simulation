  "PERSONA": "Meet Margaret \"Maggie\" Thompson, a 68-year-old white female and the primary household member of a married-couple family with kids in a small suburban town in Wyoming. She has been married to her high school sweetheart, John, for 45 years, and they have two adult children who are now independent, with the youngest having moved out of the house 5 years ago.\n\nMaggie is a U.S. citizen by birth, originally from rural Montana, but has lived in Wyoming for over 30 years. She completed her high school education through the 11th grade but did not receive her diploma due to family obligations and a part-time job. Despite this, she has been continuously employed throughout her life, currently working as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance firm in Casper, Wyoming, earning $35,000 annually.\n\nMaggie's household income is supplemented by her husband John's income as a semi-retired mechanic, who works on a part-time basis for a local auto repair shop, adding another $25,000 to their annual household income. They own their home, a modest 3-bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood near their children's schools, with an outstanding mortgage of $80,000.\n\nMaggie's family is her top priority, and she spends most of her free time gardening, cooking, and attending her grandchildren's school events. Her economic concerns are centered around retirement security, as she is worried about the impact of inflation on their fixed income and the rising healthcare costs, which might affect their ability to maintain their current lifestyle.\n\nMaggie speaks English fluently and is proficient in it, having never spoken another language at home. Her lack of a high school diploma has not hindered her career advancement, but she wishes she had more education to secure better-paying job opportunities. Maggie and her family are proud of their American heritage and value the freedom and opportunities the country has provided them.\n\nIn terms of economic and political views, Maggie is conservative, prioritizing fiscal responsibility and lower taxes, which she believes would help her family and community prosper. However, she also supports social programs that benefit seniors and education, as she understands the importance of these services for her community's well-being."
