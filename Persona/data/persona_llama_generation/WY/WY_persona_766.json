  "PERSONA": "John \"Jack\" Thompson, a 68-year-old White male, is a long-time resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming, specifically living in the historic downtown area. He has been married to his wife, Deborah, for 43 years. They have two adult children who have moved out of the family home, both of whom are married with their own families. Jack's wife is the primary householder, as she is a successful real estate agent, while Jack works as a part-time maintenance manager at a local community college, having scaled back his work hours after reaching 65.\n\nBorn in Casper, Wyoming, Jack moved to Cheyenne for college and never left. He holds an Associate's degree in Mechanical Technology from Laramie County Community College. After completing his education, Jack worked as a full-time mechanic for over two decades before transitioning into facility management roles. His current job allows him to stay active and engaged while giving him ample time to pursue his hobbies, including woodworking and fishing.\n\nJack's household income is approximately $62,000 per year, with his wife's income from real estate sales making up about 60% of their total earnings. They own their home, a two-story, three-bedroom house built in the 1920s, which they've lovingly restored over the years. Their mortgage is nearly paid off, and they expect to own the property outright within the next five years.\n\nJack's economic concerns are centered around ensuring a comfortable retirement for himself and his wife. He is worried about the impact of inflation on their fixed income and the rising costs of healthcare. Despite these concerns, Jack feels fortunate to have been able to maintain his employment in a field he enjoys, allowing him to contribute to the household income while staying active in his community.\n\nPolitically, Jack leans conservative, particularly on fiscal issues, but he is also keenly interested in environmental policies affecting Wyoming, such as land use and conservation. His experience as a maintenance manager has given him a practical perspective on the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection. Jack and his wife are active in local community organizations focused on historic preservation and outdoor recreation, reflecting their love for Wyoming's natural beauty and rich history."
