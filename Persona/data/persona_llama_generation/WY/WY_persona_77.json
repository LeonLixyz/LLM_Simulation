  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 29-year-old married white female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She resides in a household with her husband and her younger brother, who is currently a college student. Alex is a sales representative at a local outdoor gear store, leveraging her passion for the outdoors, which is abundant in Wyoming. Her annual household income is $124,500, with her being the primary breadwinner.\n\nAlex is a high school graduate from a local Wyoming school and has not pursued higher education due to financial constraints and a desire to enter the workforce early. She has been married for three years to her husband, who works part-time and is pursuing a degree in environmental science. Her brother, who lives with them, is a sophomore at the University of Wyoming, studying business administration.\n\nThe household owns a modest, two-story home in a suburban area of Cheyenne, valued at approximately $280,000, with a mortgage of $1,800 per month. They have one vehicle, a 2018 Subaru Outback, which they use for both personal and professional purposes.\n\nAlex's economic concerns include the rising cost of living, especially housing and healthcare, and the impact of seasonal fluctuations in the tourism industry on her job security. She and her husband are planning to start a family soon, which adds to her concerns about job stability and the need for a reliable income. Despite these concerns, Alex values the quality of life in Wyoming and hopes to continue living and working there.\n\nPolitically, Alex is moderately conservative, influenced by her upbringing and the prevailing political sentiments in Wyoming. However, her environmental concerns, partly due to her husband's studies and their shared love for the outdoors, have made her more open to policies that address climate change and conservation. Her primary political priorities include economic stability, job creation, affordable healthcare, and education reform."
