  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson is a 28-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming. She resides with her parents in a moderate-sized, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood. Despite being divorced, Emily's marital status is somewhat of an anomaly, given her young age; she was married briefly at 22 but divorced two years later due to irreconcilable differences. Her ex-husband was also a Wyoming native, and they met while attending Casper College. Emily has no children from the marriage.\n\nEmily works as a dental assistant at a local clinic, earning a yearly income of $38,500. She chose this career path due to its relatively short training period and the prospect of stable employment. Her work schedule is regular, with some evenings spent taking continuing education courses to improve her skills and potentially move into a higher-paying role.\n\nEmily's educational background includes completing two years of coursework at Casper College but not obtaining a degree. She initially pursued a degree in business administration but found the curriculum too theoretical and decided to enter the workforce instead. She now regrets not finishing her degree but is hesitant to take on student loans.\n\nAs a child living with her parents, Emily contributes $500 monthly to the household expenses, which helps her parents with the mortgage and utility bills. Her parents, both in their late 50s, are semi-retired; her father works part-time as a handyman, and her mother is a retired librarian. Emily's living situation allows her to save money, which she uses to pay off her car loan and build an emergency fund.\n\nEmily's economic concerns revolve around achieving financial stability and independence. She aims to purchase her own home within the next five years and is working on improving her credit score. She is also interested in furthering her education but is unsure about the financial implications. Emily is an English-only speaker, born in the state of Montana but raised in Wyoming. Her family moved to Casper when she was 10 years old, and she considers Wyoming her home state.\n\nEmily's political views are moderate, leaning slightly conservative due to her upbringing and the local culture in Casper. She values economic growth, job creation, and affordable education. However, she is also concerned about healthcare access and environmental conservation, particularly in the context of Wyoming's natural resources. Emily is not actively involved in politics but votes in local and national elections, prioritizing issues that directly impact her community and personal life."
