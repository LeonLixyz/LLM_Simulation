  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 22-year-old white male living with his parents in a suburban area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Although he is technically divorced, this is due to his parents' recent separation, and he remains in the family home. Ethan is a US citizen, born in Denver, Colorado, but has lived in Wyoming for most of his life. He speaks English fluently and has a high school diploma from Cheyenne East High School.\n\nEthan works as a part-time sales associate at a local outdoor gear store in downtown Cheyenne, earning approximately $28,000 per year. His job requires him to work varying shifts, including weekends, which can sometimes conflict with his desire to pursue higher education or vocational training. Ethan's parents, though separated, are supportive of his career aspirations and encourage him to explore opportunities that align with his passion for the outdoors.\n\nAs a young adult living with his parents, Ethan contributes to household expenses by paying a modest rent of $400 per month, which helps him develop a sense of financial responsibility. He shares a room with his younger sister, who is still in high school. The family resides in a moderately priced neighborhood with a mix of single-family homes and apartment complexes.\n\nEthan's economic concerns center around saving money for college or vocational training, as he hopes to pursue a career in environmental conservation or a related field. He is interested in politics, particularly issues related to public lands, wildlife conservation, and sustainable development. Ethan's experiences living in Wyoming, a state with a strong outdoor recreation economy, have instilled in him a deep appreciation for the natural world and a desire to contribute to its preservation.\n\nAssumption: Given Ethan's age, employment status, and living situation, it is assumed that he is not the primary breadwinner in the household and has some financial support from his parents."
