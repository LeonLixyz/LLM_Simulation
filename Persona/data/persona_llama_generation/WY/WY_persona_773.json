  "PERSONA": "Meet 57-year-old Ryan Thompson, a married male living in a rural area of Wyoming, specifically in the town of Cody, which has a population of approximately 10,000 residents. Ryan's household consists of his wife, Karen, and his 87-year-old widowed father, with whom they share a spacious, single-family home. The house, valued at $280,000, is fully owned by Ryan and his wife, with no outstanding mortgage. Ryan's father contributes to household expenses by paying a modest monthly rent.\n\nRyan's educational background includes two years of study in mechanical engineering at Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming. Although he did not complete his degree, his college education has been beneficial in his career as a maintenance supervisor at a local manufacturing plant. Ryan's job, which he has held for over a decade, pays $62,000 per year, with benefits including health insurance and a 401(k) plan. His wife, Karen, works part-time as a librarian at the local library, earning $25,000 annually.\n\nRyan and Karen have been married for 32 years, and they have two adult children who have moved out of the house. Their eldest son, Alex, is a software engineer living in Denver, Colorado, and their daughter, Emily, is a nurse in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Both children are financially independent, but Ryan and Karen provide some financial support to help with their grandchildren's education expenses.\n\nRyan's primary economic concerns are related to the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing prices of groceries and healthcare. He is also worried about the impact of inflation on his retirement savings, as he hopes to retire in about eight years. Ryan's political views are moderate, with a focus on local issues such as public land management, education, and infrastructure development. He is a registered Republican but often votes for candidates from both parties based on their stance on specific issues affecting his community.\n\nIn his free time, Ryan enjoys hunting, fishing, and volunteering at local community events. He is an active member of the Cody Rotary Club and participates in their annual charity fundraisers. Ryan's language proficiency is English only, which has not been a limitation in his personal or professional life, given the predominantly English-speaking population in Wyoming."
