  "PERSONA": "Margaret 'Maggie' Thompson, a 62-year-old white female, resides in a small town in rural Wyoming with her husband, James. Born in Montana, Maggie moved to Wyoming over 30 years ago when James, a retired mechanic, took a job in the local automotive industry. She is a high school graduate, having completed her education at a public school in Montana before moving. Maggie is fluent in English and has never had a need to learn another language due to her geographic location and cultural context.\n\nMaggie has been married to James for 38 years and has two adult children, both of whom have moved away for college and work. Her daughter is a teacher in a nearby town, and her son works in the energy sector in Denver, Colorado. Maggie and James have two grandchildren who live close enough to visit frequently.\n\nAlthough Maggie worked part-time jobs while raising her children, she has not been in the labor force for over a decade, choosing to focus on family and community activities. Her last job was as a part-time administrative assistant in a local doctor's office. Maggie's decision to leave the workforce was largely influenced by her desire to care for her aging parents, who lived with them until they passed away.\n\nMaggie and James own their home, a modest two-story house on the outskirts of town, which they purchased in the early 1990s. The house is nearly paid off, with only a small mortgage remaining. They have a small garden and a few acres of land where James keeps a couple of horses as a hobby.\n\nMaggie's economic concerns are centered around healthcare and the rising costs of living in rural America. With James's retirement and her own decision not to work, they rely on his pension and social security for income. Maggie is worried about the future of these programs and the potential impact of policy changes on their financial stability. She is also concerned about the lack of access to quality healthcare services in their area, which has become a significant issue as they age.\n\nIn terms of political views, Maggie tends to vote conservatively, aligning with the dominant political leaning in her community. However, she is not a strict party liner and will vote for candidates who she believes genuinely care about the issues affecting rural communities, such as access to healthcare and support for local businesses. Maggie is an active member of her community, participating in local volunteer work and advocating for policies that benefit her town and its residents."
