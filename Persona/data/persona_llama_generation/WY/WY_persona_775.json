  "PERSONA": "Meet Janet Thompson, a 62-year-old female who lives in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the spouse of a household, she resides with her husband, James, in a small, two-story house in the historic downtown area, which they purchased 10 years ago for $250,000. The couple has a combined annual income of around $75,000, with Janet contributing approximately $35,000 as a part-time sales associate at a local outdoor gear store. She works around 25 hours a week, with a regular schedule that allows her to care for her elderly mother who lives nearby. \n\nJanet was born in Wyoming and has lived there her entire life. She attended Cheyenne East High School but did not graduate, instead opting to pursue a job in retail to support her family after her parents passed away in her teenage years. Her lack of a high school diploma has somewhat limited her career advancement opportunities, but she values the stability and flexibility her current job provides.\n\nJanet's husband, James, is a 65-year-old retired mechanic who now works part-time as a handyman. They have two adult children who have moved out of the house and are pursuing their careers in other parts of the state. Janet's family responsibilities are now primarily focused on caring for her 80-year-old mother, who lives in a nearby assisted living facility. Janet visits her mother at least three times a week and helps with errands and medical appointments.\n\nGiven her financial situation, Janet is concerned about saving for retirement, as she does not have a substantial 401(k) or pension plan. She relies on her husband's social security benefits and her part-time income to make ends meet. Janet is also worried about the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly housing costs, which she believes are pricing out long-time residents like herself. As a result, she is skeptical of policies that she perceives as favoring large corporations or wealthy developers over local residents."
