  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson is a 27-year-old white female, born in Oregon but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with her parents. She is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently, having never spoken another language at home. Alex has never been married and is not a veteran. She lives with her parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, where they have resided for over five years.\n\nAlex attended Cheyenne's East High School and later enrolled in Laramie County Community College, pursuing an associate's degree in business administration. However, she dropped out after two years due to personal reasons and has not yet returned to college. Despite this, she maintains a strong interest in entrepreneurship and business management.\n\nAs Alex is not in the labor force, she does not have a specific job title or sector. Her primary focus is on personal development and exploring career opportunities that align with her interests. She spends most of her time volunteering at a local animal shelter, which she is passionate about, and assisting her parents with household chores.\n\nHer parents, both in their mid-50s, are her primary source of financial support. Her father works as an accountant in a small firm, while her mother is a part-time librarian at the local public library. The family's combined income is around $75,000 per year, which is above the median household income in Wyoming.\n\nAlex's economic concerns include saving for higher education, finding a stable job, and eventually moving out of her parents' house to gain independence. She is keenly interested in local economic development initiatives, particularly those focused on supporting small businesses and entrepreneurship. Her political views are shaped by her experiences and concerns, prioritizing education, job creation, and community development."
