  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Deborah Wilson, a white, US-born female residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Deborah is the primary householder of her household, which she shares with her partner of 15 years, Mark, in a long-term, committed relationship, though they have chosen not to get married. As a non-veteran, Deborah's life has been marked by a strong work ethic and dedication to her career.\n\nDeborah holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Laramie County Community College, which she obtained at the age of 25. This educational background has served her well in her role as an Office Manager at a small, locally-owned insurance firm in Cheyenne, where she has been employed for the past 20 years. Her annual income is $53,000, which, combined with Mark's income as a high school teacher, provides them with a comfortable middle-class lifestyle.\n\nDeborah and Mark reside in a modest, single-family home in a quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of Cheyenne, which they purchased in 2005 for $180,000. They have no children, which allows them to allocate their resources towards hobbies and travel. Deborah is an avid hiker and enjoys exploring the natural beauty of Wyoming in her free time.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Deborah is deeply concerned about the economic implications of the state's reliance on the energy industry. She worries about the potential for economic downturns in the event of a decline in the fossil fuel market and the impact this could have on local businesses and employment opportunities. Deborah is also passionate about education and believes that investing in local schools and community colleges is crucial for the state's economic future.\n\nDeborah's economic priorities include maintaining a stable and secure retirement, which she hopes to achieve through a combination of her employer-sponsored 401(k) plan and careful budgeting. She is also interested in exploring ways to support local businesses and promote economic diversification in Wyoming, recognizing the importance of a resilient economy for the well-being of her community."
