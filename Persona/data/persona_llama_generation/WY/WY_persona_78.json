  "PERSONA": "David Thompson is a 57-year-old male, identifying as White and Native American, living in the city of Cheyenne, Wyoming. He resides with his parents due to family caregiving responsibilities, as his father requires assistance with daily activities. David is married to his wife, Karen, and they have been together for over 20 years. They do not have any children of their own.\n\nDavid holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he earned in 1989. This educational background has served him well in his career as a Management Consultant, a position he has held at a mid-sized firm in Cheyenne for the past decade. His annual income is $85,000, and he has private health insurance through his employer.\n\nDavid was born in Colorado but has lived in Wyoming for most of his life. He is a US citizen and speaks English fluently, with no other languages spoken at home. As a non-veteran, David does not have any military background.\n\nDavid's household is a unique situation, where he is the primary caregiver for his aging parents. This has led to some financial adjustments, as he contributes significantly to the household income while also managing his parents' care expenses. Despite these challenges, David values his role in supporting his family and is committed to ensuring their well-being.\n\nIn terms of economic concerns, David is particularly worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact on his parents' care. He is also concerned about the stability of his job and the local economy, given Wyoming's reliance on the energy industry. These concerns influence his views on economic and political issues, leading him to support policies that promote job security, affordable healthcare, and family support services."
