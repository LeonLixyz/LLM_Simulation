  "PERSONA": "John Smith, a 49-year-old white male, is the primary householder of his single-person household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As a high school graduate, John has a diploma from Cheyenne Central High School. He was born in Billings, Montana, but has lived in Wyoming for over a decade, having moved for better job opportunities in the energy sector. \n\nJohn's marital status is separated; he was married for about 8 years before the separation, but they did not have any children together. John's English proficiency is excellent, as it is his native language. \n\nAs a non-veteran, John entered the workforce directly after high school, starting as a mechanic's apprentice in a local garage. Over the years, he worked his way up to become a senior mechanic specializing in diesel engines, which led to a better-paying job at a major trucking company in Cheyenne. His annual income is $58,000, which is above the median household income in Wyoming but still modest considering his experience and specialization.\n\nJohn rents a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Cheyenne for $1,200 per month. His primary economic concerns are saving enough for retirement, as his current job offers a 401(k) plan but requires him to contribute a significant portion of his income. He is also concerned about the volatility of the energy sector and the potential for job insecurity. Despite these concerns, John values the independence that comes with his job and the freedom to travel within the state for work.\n\nPolitically, John tends to lean conservative, influenced by Wyoming's strong tradition of individualism and limited government intervention. However, his experience with healthcare access in rural areas has made him more open to discussions about healthcare reform, particularly in how it affects workers in his sector who often have limited access to quality, affordable care."
