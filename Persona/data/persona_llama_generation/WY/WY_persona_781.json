  "PERSONA": "Meet Sarah Jenkins, a 39-year-old divorced woman living in Casper, Wyoming. She was born in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming, which has been her lifelong home. As a high school graduate, Sarah's educational background has equipped her with a solid foundation for her career. She works as a dental hygienist in a private dental clinic in Casper, earning an annual income of $62,000. \n\nSarah's labor force participation is a crucial aspect of her life, as she is the primary breadwinner for her 10-year-old son, who lives with her full-time. Her ex-husband, though divorced, contributes to their son's upbringing through regular child support payments. This financial assistance has been instrumental in helping Sarah maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nSarah rents a two-bedroom apartment in a relatively safe and family-friendly neighborhood in Casper, paying $900 per month. Despite her stable income, she has not yet considered purchasing a home due to the financial constraints of raising her son alone. Her monthly expenses include $500 for groceries, $150 for her son's after-school activities, and $200 for entertainment and leisure activities. \n\nAs a single mother, Sarah's economic concerns revolve around ensuring a secure future for her son. She prioritizes saving for his college education and is keenly interested in policies that support working families, affordable healthcare, and quality education. Sarah's experience as a divorced mother has also made her more aware of the importance of social safety nets and community support services.\n\nIn her free time, Sarah enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and camping in the nearby mountains. She is an active member of her community, often volunteering at local events and participating in parent-teacher association meetings at her son's school."
