  "PERSONA": "Meet Alexis \"Lexi\" Thompson, a 28-year-old woman living in Casper, Wyoming. She identifies as biracial, with a white mother and a black father. Lexi is a high school graduate, having completed her education at a public school in her hometown of Cheyenne, Wyoming. After high school, she moved to Casper for better job opportunities. \n\nLexi works as a dental assistant in a local clinic, earning an annual salary of $38,000. She has been employed in this role for three years, having completed a certification program in dental assisting after high school. She is the primary household earner, as her ex-husband, whom she divorced two years ago, is not currently providing any financial support.\n\nLexi's marital status is divorced, and she has no children. She lives alone in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom rental apartment in a modest neighborhood in Casper. Her monthly rent is $900, which is relatively affordable given the local cost of living. She owns a 2017 Honda Civic, which she purchased used last year for $13,000.\n\nLexi is concerned about healthcare access and affordability, as her job provides limited benefits, and she struggles to make ends meet. She is also worried about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly housing costs, which she fears may force her to move to a different state in search of more affordable options. She is interested in local and national politics, especially policies related to healthcare, education, and economic development.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- Lexi's specific location within Wyoming is Casper, the second-largest city in the state, which offers a relatively diverse range of job opportunities.\n- Her job as a dental assistant is consistent with her high school education and provides a stable income.\n- Lexi's divorce and lack of children are assumed to be a result of personal circumstances rather than economic necessity.\n- Her concerns about healthcare and affordability are based on her limited job benefits and the rising cost of living in Wyoming."
