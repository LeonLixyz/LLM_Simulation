  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Maria Hern\u00e1ndez, a 49-year-old US-born woman of White ethnicity, residing in Casper, Wyoming. Despite being a primary householder, Ana Maria's marital status is listed as \"Never married,\" which could be due to her being in a long-term, unmarried partnership, a reasonable assumption given the \"Married-couple Without kids\" household type. She lives with her partner, Juan, in a modest, rented two-bedroom apartment in a mixed-income neighborhood near downtown Casper.\n\nAna Maria was born in New Mexico but has lived in Wyoming for over a decade, initially moving for education and career opportunities. She has \"Some college, no degree\" in Hospitality Management from Casper College, which she attended part-time while working. This educational background has been beneficial for her current job as a front desk supervisor at a mid-range hotel in Casper, earning an annual income of $38,500. Her job involves frequent interactions with guests, requiring her to communicate in English, a language she speaks less than very well, often relying on her native Spanish with Spanish-speaking guests or colleagues.\n\nAs a non-veteran and non-parent, Ana Maria's economic concerns are centered around job security, healthcare costs, and saving for retirement. Her household income is supplemented by Juan's income as a mechanic, totaling around $65,000 annually. Despite not being homeowners, they are considering purchasing a home in the next few years, which is a significant economic priority for them.\n\nAna Maria's political views are likely influenced by her economic situation and the challenges faced by the Hispanic community in Wyoming, despite her not identifying with a particular ethnicity. She may prioritize policies that support affordable housing, improve access to healthcare, and promote economic growth in her community, reflecting her personal experiences and the broader needs of Casper's residents."
