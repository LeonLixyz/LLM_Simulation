  "PERSONA": "Meet 62-year-old Deborah Johnson, a high school graduate and the primary householder of her single-person household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Deborah has been married for 38 years but is currently separated from her husband. She was born in Illinois but has lived in Wyoming for over 20 years, having moved for her husband's job. Deborah's birthplace outside of Wyoming but within the US influences her perspective on regional differences and economic policies that affect interstate migration.\n\nDeborah works as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company, earning $42,000 per year. Her employment status and income bracket place her in a stable but not affluent position, making her concerned about retirement savings and the cost of living. As someone who has been in the labor force consistently, Deborah values job security and is likely to support policies that promote employment stability and workers' rights.\n\nLiving in a small single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Deborah is a homeowner with a mortgage. Her housing situation is relatively stable, but she is mindful of property taxes and the impact of local economic policies on homeowners. Deborah's household income and expenses are manageable, but she has to budget carefully to cover her expenses, including her mortgage, utilities, and car payments.\n\nDeborah's educational background as a high school graduate has limited her career advancement opportunities, but she has developed strong administrative skills through on-the-job training and experience. Her education level and career path influence her views on education policy, particularly vocational training and adult education programs that could help others in similar situations.\n\nAs a single female household without kids, Deborah's family structure affects her economic priorities. She is concerned about healthcare costs, retirement security, and social safety nets, as she relies solely on her income and does not have a spouse or children to share responsibilities with. Deborah's marital status, although separated, may also influence her views on family law and social policies related to marriage and divorce.\n\nDeborah's language proficiency in English only may limit her interaction with non-English speaking communities, but she is an engaged citizen who follows local news and participates in community events. Her birth in the US and citizenship status make her eligible to vote, and she exercises this right in local and national elections. Deborah's economic concerns, influenced by her demographic characteristics, drive her political views and inform her decisions at the ballot box."
