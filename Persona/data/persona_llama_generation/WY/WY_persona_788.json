  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Ryan Thompson, a white male living in Casper, Wyoming, with his parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood. Ryan is a high school graduate, having completed his education at Natrona County High School in 2004. He never pursued higher education due to financial constraints and the need to support his family.\n\nRyan is employed as a maintenance worker at a local oil refinery, a job he secured through a family connection. His annual income is $52,000, which is slightly above the median household income in Casper. Although he contributes to the household income, Ryan still relies on his parents for housing, as he is not yet financially stable enough to afford his own place.\n\nRyan has never been married and does not have any children. His social life is relatively limited, with most of his free time spent with family or engaging in outdoor activities like hunting and fishing, which are popular in Wyoming.\n\nRyan's employment in the oil industry makes him concerned about the economic impact of environmental policies on his job security and the local economy. He is also worried about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly housing costs, which he believes are becoming unaffordable for many residents.\n\nRyan's experience living with his parents at an older age is not uncommon in Wyoming, where the cost of living is relatively high, and wages can be lower than in other parts of the country. Despite this, Ryan is proud of his independence and is working towards saving enough money to move into his own place in the near future.\n\nAssumptions made based on the metadata:\n\n* Ryan's parents are likely in their 60s, and their age and potential health issues may contribute to Ryan's decision to live with them.\n* Ryan's job as a maintenance worker at an oil refinery is a common occupation in Wyoming, given the state's significant oil industry.\n* Ryan's lack of higher education may limit his career advancement opportunities, but his job provides a stable income and benefits.\n* Ryan's social life is relatively limited due to his family responsibilities and the need to focus on his career."
