  "PERSONA": "Linda Kay Reynolds is a 68-year-old white female living in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her husband of 47 years, James, a retired mechanic. Linda has been a veteran of the US Army, serving as a nurse from 1976 to 1981. After her service, she continued her education through vocational training and obtained a certificate in dental assisting. Currently, Linda is employed as a dental assistant in a private practice in Cheyenne, working part-time, approximately 25 hours a week, earning around $35,000 per year.\n\nLinda is a high school graduate from a public school in her birth state of Nebraska, where she grew up. She relocated to Wyoming 40 years ago after meeting her husband while he was working in the oil fields. They have two children, both of whom have moved out of the house, but their youngest son, who is 32 years old, recently moved back in with them due to job loss during the pandemic. He contributes $500 towards the household expenses each month.\n\nLinda and her husband own their current residence, a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom house valued at approximately $280,000, with an ongoing mortgage of $1,200 per month. They also have two cars, a 2015 Honda Civic and a 2010 Ford F-150 truck, with a combined car loan and insurance payment of $600 per month.\n\nLinda's main economic concerns are healthcare costs, as her husband is dealing with chronic health issues and she is worried about the rising costs of medication and potential long-term care. She is also concerned about the impact of inflation on their fixed income and the potential for Social Security benefits to be reduced in the future. Politically, Linda leans conservative due to her husband's influence but has become more liberal on healthcare issues due to their personal experiences."
