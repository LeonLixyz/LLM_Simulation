  "PERSONA": "John Harris, a 57-year-old White male, resides in the town of Laramie, Wyoming. Born in Montana, John moved to Wyoming for work opportunities. He lives with his wife, Karen, 54, and their two children, Emily, 19, and Michael, 16. John and Karen have been married for 25 years.\n\nAs the primary householder, John works as an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) technician for a local company in Laramie, with a yearly income of $87,500. His job requires him to travel across Albany County for installations, maintenance, and repairs. John's education background includes completing 11th grade at his local high school in Montana but not obtaining a diploma due to needing to work and support his family after his father's passing.\n\nJohn and his family rent a three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Laramie, paying $1,400 per month. Their household also includes two vehicles: a 2018 Ford F-150 for work and a 2015 Toyota Camry for family use.\n\nJohn's family is covered under his employer-provided private health insurance plan, which also includes dental and vision coverage. He is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military.\n\nJohn's primary economic concerns include saving for his children's college funds, planning for retirement, and managing the increasing costs of living in Wyoming, particularly housing and healthcare. He values job security and stability, having experienced the economic downturn in 2008, which affected his work in the construction industry at the time.\n\nJohn's family is active in their community, often participating in local events and volunteering at their children's schools. They enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing in the nearby mountains during their free time."
