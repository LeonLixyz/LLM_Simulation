  "PERSONA": "Meet Sandra Jenkins, a 57-year-old White female who resides in a small, rural town in Wyoming, specifically in the city of Cody. Born in Montana, Sandra has lived in Wyoming for over a decade. As the primary householder, she occupies a modest, rented single-family home in a quiet neighborhood near the outskirts of Cody, with an approximate monthly rent of $800. \n\nSandra never married and does not have any children. Her household is simple, with basic amenities, reflecting her modest lifestyle. She is a non-veteran and has been out of the labor force for several years due to a combination of factors, including health issues and a lack of job opportunities in her area of expertise. \n\nSandra's educational background consists of completing the 11th grade but not receiving a high school diploma. Despite not finishing high school, she has developed strong skills in basic accounting and bookkeeping through vocational training programs and online courses. However, her lack of a high school diploma has limited her job prospects and career advancement opportunities.\n\nPrior to leaving the workforce, Sandra worked as an administrative assistant in a local small business, earning approximately $25,000 per year. Her income is now primarily comprised of Social Security benefits and occasional, part-time work as a freelance bookkeeper for friends' small businesses, amounting to around $18,000 annually.\n\nSandra's economic concerns center around affording healthcare, maintaining her current standard of living on a limited income, and dealing with the rising costs of living in a rural area. Her primary economic priorities include accessing affordable healthcare, reducing her living expenses, and potentially finding part-time work that can supplement her income without jeopardizing her Social Security benefits.\n\nIn terms of her views on economic and political policies, Sandra tends to focus on issues directly affecting her daily life, such as healthcare accessibility, cost of living, and job opportunities in rural areas. She is likely to support policies that promote affordable healthcare, increase funding for vocational training programs, and address the economic challenges faced by rural communities."
