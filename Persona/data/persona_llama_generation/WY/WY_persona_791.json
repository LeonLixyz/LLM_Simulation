  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson is a 29-year-old white male, born and raised in Casper, Wyoming. He is a high school graduate from Natrona County High School and has been married for about 5 years but is currently separated from his wife, awaiting a divorce. Ethan lives in a rented two-bedroom apartment in the downtown area of Casper, where he shares the space with a roommate to split the cost. He works as a maintenance technician at a local oil refinery, a job he secured after serving in the US Army for 4 years as a mechanic. Ethan's annual salary is $52,000, and he has been working at the refinery for about 3 years. He has no children but is close to his wife's 7-year-old son from a previous relationship, whom he considers his stepson.\n\nEthan's education and military experience have significantly influenced his career trajectory, allowing him to secure a stable job in a sector that is prominent in Wyoming's economy. His economic concerns include the fluctuating job security due to the oil industry's sensitivity to global market changes and the rising cost of living in Casper, which has seen an influx of new residents due to the area's natural gas boom. Despite these concerns, Ethan values the stability his job provides and is optimistic about his future prospects, especially with the growing need for skilled technicians in the energy sector.\n\nGiven his military background, Ethan is keenly interested in veterans' affairs and supports policies that improve healthcare services and employment opportunities for veterans. His experience as a separated father also makes him concerned about policies affecting family law and child support. Ethan's living situation and job have made him aware of the importance of affordable housing and the need for infrastructure development to accommodate the growing population in Wyoming's urban areas."
