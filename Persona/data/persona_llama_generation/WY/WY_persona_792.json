  "PERSONA": "John Taylor, a 49-year-old White male, is the primary householder of a married couple household without kids in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is a US-born citizen, born in the state of Wyoming, and speaks only English. John holds a Master's degree in Business Administration, which he earned from the University of Wyoming after completing his undergraduate studies in finance.\n\nJohn is currently employed as a Financial Manager at a mid-sized bank in downtown Cheyenne, earning a salary of $85,000 per year. He has been working in the financial sector for over 15 years, starting as a financial analyst and gradually moving up the corporate ladder. John's job requires him to oversee financial planning, budgeting, and forecasting for the bank's operations in Wyoming.\n\nJohn has been married to his wife, Sarah, for 10 years. She is a part-time librarian at a local library, working 20 hours a week. They met while pursuing their graduate studies at the University of Wyoming and decided to settle in Cheyenne due to its small-town charm and proximity to the mountains. They own a modest, two-bedroom house in the Historic District of Cheyenne, which they purchased 7 years ago for $280,000. The mortgage payment is $1,800 per month, which is manageable given their combined income.\n\nJohn's household income is $110,000 per year, which places them in the upper-middle-class bracket in Wyoming. They have two cars, a 2018 Toyota 4Runner and a 2020 Honda Civic, which they use for daily commutes and weekend getaways to the mountains. John is concerned about the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly the increasing property taxes and healthcare costs. He is also worried about the impact of economic downturns on the banking sector and the potential for job insecurity.\n\nJohn's educational background and career trajectory have instilled in him a strong sense of financial responsibility and planning. He is a conservative investor, preferring low-risk investments in index funds and bonds. John is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to economic development, education, and healthcare. He votes regularly in local and national elections, leaning towards moderate Republican candidates who support business-friendly policies and limited government intervention in the economy."
