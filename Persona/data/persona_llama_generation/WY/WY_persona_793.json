  "PERSONA": "A 48-year-old woman of mixed White and American Indian descent, living in Casper, Wyoming, with her husband, a 50-year-old oil rig worker, in her parents' household, due to financial constraints. She is employed as a dental hygienist at a private practice, earning $52,000 per year, while her husband makes $70,000 annually. She has some college education, having attended Casper College for two years to pursue a degree in dental hygiene but didn't complete it due to family obligations.\n\nShe has been married for 10 years and has two children, ages 8 and 10, who attend a local public school. Her parents, both in their early 70s, own the house they all live in, which has been in the family for three generations. The house is a three-bedroom, two-bathroom ranch-style home in a suburban neighborhood with a mix of old and new houses.\n\nGiven her employment and her husband's job, they are concerned about the fluctuating oil prices affecting their livelihood, as the oil industry is a significant sector in Wyoming's economy. They are also worried about the quality of education their children receive in the local public school system, as funding has been inconsistent. Her family's economic situation is stable, but they are cautious about the future due to the state's reliance on the energy industry and potential impacts of economic downturns.\n\nHer mixed heritage is an important part of her identity, and she tries to pass on her Native American traditions to her children. However, she doesn't speak any Native American languages fluently, only a few words and phrases passed down from her grandmother. She speaks English well, having grown up in a predominantly English-speaking household.\n\nShe is a US citizen by birth and has always lived in Wyoming, making her deeply rooted in the community. Her economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable education, and access to quality healthcare for her family."
