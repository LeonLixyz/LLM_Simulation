  "PERSONA": "Diane Louise Thompson, a 68-year-old White female, lives alone in a modest, single-story house in the town of Cody, Wyoming. As the primary householder, she owns her home outright, having paid off the mortgage after years of diligent saving and budgeting. \n\nA divorced veteran of the US Army, Diane served for six years as a medical administrative specialist, achieving the rank of Sergeant. After her service, she utilized her GI Bill benefits to pursue higher education but didn't complete her degree due to personal circumstances. Despite this, she leveraged her administrative experience to secure a job as a medical records clerk at a local hospital, where she has worked for over two decades.\n\nDiane's current annual income is approximately $52,000, which allows her to maintain a relatively comfortable lifestyle in Cody, where the cost of living is lower compared to larger cities. She has a fixed-rate pension from her military service and a modest 401(k) from her employer, which supplements her retirement savings.\n\nAs a single female household without children, Diane's economic concerns revolve around maintaining her financial independence, ensuring her retirement savings are sufficient, and keeping her healthcare costs manageable. Her experience as a veteran and a long-term employee in the healthcare sector has made her particularly keen on policies related to veterans' benefits, affordable healthcare, and social security. Living in Wyoming, where the economy is heavily reliant on the energy and tourism sectors, Diane is also concerned about the state's economic diversification and the impact of environmental policies on local industries.\n\nIn her free time, Diane volunteers at the local VFW post, helping fellow veterans navigate their benefits, and participates in community events focused on women's health and wellness. Despite her busy schedule, she prioritizes her physical health, enjoying hiking and birdwatching in the scenic landscapes surrounding Cody."
