  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Rodriguez, a 22-year-old divorced mother of two, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Ana is the sole breadwinner for her family. She was born in Arizona but moved to Wyoming for better job opportunities after her divorce. Ana is a US citizen of Mexican descent, and her first language is Spanish, but she speaks English well, which she learned through her education and work experience.\n\nAna holds a Master's degree in Healthcare Administration from the University of Wyoming, which she completed while raising her children. Her graduate education has enabled her to secure a job as a Healthcare Manager at a local hospital in Cheyenne, earning an annual salary of $62,000. Her job is stable, but the cost of living in Wyoming, especially childcare, is a significant concern for her.\n\nAna's marital status as a divorced single mother adds complexity to her life. She is responsible for her 4-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son, who are both enrolled in a local public school. Despite the challenges, Ana values her independence and is determined to provide the best possible life for her children.\n\nAs a renter, Ana pays $1,200 per month for a three-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood. She hopes to save enough for a down payment on a house in the future but finds it challenging due to her expenses. Her primary economic concerns include saving for her children's education, managing the rising cost of living, and ensuring job security.\n\nAna's experience as a single mother and her background in healthcare have shaped her economic and political views. She prioritizes policies supporting affordable childcare, education, and healthcare access. She also advocates for equal pay and job opportunities for women, particularly those in male-dominated industries. Ana's specific situation makes her an active participant in local community initiatives and a keen observer of policies affecting her state and the nation."
