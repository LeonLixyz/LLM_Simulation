  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson, an 87-year-old divorced woman living in a rural area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Cheyenne, she has spent her entire life in Wyoming. Agnes holds a Master's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained in 1962. Before her retirement, Agnes worked as a librarian at a local elementary school for over three decades. She is fluent in English and has no proficiency in any other language.\n\nAgnes is the primary householder of her residence, a single-family home she owns, which is valued at approximately $250,000. Her annual property tax is around $1,800. She has been living in this house since 1975 when she moved in with her then-husband. Although she is divorced, her ex-husband passed away in 2001, and she has remained in the family home.\n\nAs a retiree, Agnes does not participate in the labor force. Her annual income is approximately $42,000, primarily consisting of her teacher's pension ($35,000) and Social Security benefits ($7,000). She also receives occasional financial support from her two adult children, who live out of state.\n\nAgnes's household expenses include a monthly mortgage payment of $800, utilities ($150), groceries ($500), and medication ($200). She allocates a significant portion of her income toward healthcare expenses, including Medicare supplemental insurance and out-of-pocket medical costs.\n\nGiven her age and health concerns, Agnes's primary economic concerns include the rising costs of healthcare, potential changes to Social Security and Medicare, and the increasing property taxes in her area. She is also concerned about the impact of inflation on her fixed income and the potential for reduced purchasing power.\n\nPolitically, Agnes is likely to prioritize issues related to healthcare, economic security for seniors, and local property tax reform. Her experiences as a retired educator and long-time resident of Wyoming have instilled in her a strong sense of community and a desire to protect the interests of rural areas."
