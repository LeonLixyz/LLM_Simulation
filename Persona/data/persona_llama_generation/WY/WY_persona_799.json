  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 48-year-old white male, born and raised in Wyoming. He resides in the town of Casper, specifically in the older, working-class neighborhood of Paradise Valley. Ryan is married to his wife, Rachel, who is the primary household earner, working as a school administrator. They have two children, ages 10 and 12, both enrolled in the local public school system.\n\nRyan has some college education, having attended Casper College for two years before dropping out due to financial constraints. He currently works as a maintenance supervisor at a local oil refinery, earning an annual income of $65,000. His job is physically demanding, but it provides a stable income and decent benefits, which are essential for supporting his family.\n\nAs a spouse of the household earner, Ryan's role is multifaceted. He manages the household finances, ensuring they stay within budget, and handles most of the childcare responsibilities, including driving the kids to school and extracurricular activities. Ryan is proud of his role as a father and husband, and he prioritizes his family's well-being above all else.\n\nThe Thompsons own a modest, single-family home in Paradise Valley, which they purchased 10 years ago for $180,000. The neighborhood is relatively affordable, with a mix of old and new homes, and a strong sense of community. Ryan is concerned about the rising property taxes and the impact of Wyoming's economic fluctuations on the local housing market.\n\nRyan's economic concerns are centered around job security, affordable healthcare, and education. As a refinery worker, he is aware of the industry's volatility and the potential for layoffs. He also worries about the quality of public education in Wyoming, particularly in rural areas, and the lack of access to affordable healthcare options.\n\nPolitically, Ryan identifies as a moderate conservative, leaning towards pragmatic, solution-oriented policies that benefit his community. He is skeptical of partisan politics and prioritizes issues that directly affect his family and local economy. Ryan's voting decisions are guided by his concerns about job security, education, and access to affordable healthcare."
