  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 49-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Ryan resides in a single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood with his two children, Emily (12) and Jackson (9), from his previous marriage. Despite being divorced for three years, Ryan prioritizes being involved in his children's lives and ensures they have a stable environment. \n\nRyan was born in Montana but moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age. He attended Cheyenne Central High School but dropped out in his senior year due to family circumstances, never obtaining his high school diploma. This setback, however, did not deter Ryan from pursuing a career. He found work in the construction sector, starting as a laborer and working his way up to become a construction supervisor for a local firm. He earns an annual income of $62,000, which allows him to provide for his children's needs and maintain a modest lifestyle.\n\nRyan's primary concerns revolve around securing better-paying jobs in Wyoming to improve his financial stability and ensuring quality education for his children. He is particularly interested in policies that support vocational training and apprenticeships, as he believes these programs could benefit young people like his own children who may not be inclined towards college. Ryan's economic priorities also include affordable healthcare, as he struggles to cover medical expenses for his children, especially since his ex-wife's job does not offer comprehensive health insurance.\n\nAs a non-voter in previous elections, Ryan has become increasingly interested in local politics due to issues affecting his community, such as the impact of environmental policies on Wyoming's energy sector and its potential to affect his job. Despite not holding a college degree, Ryan values education and wishes for better funding for Wyoming's public schools to improve the quality of education for his children and the community at large."
