  "PERSONA": "Meet Alberto Ramirez, a 68-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, living in Casper, Wyoming, a city known for its strong energy industry presence and a cost of living slightly lower than the national average. Alberto is the spouse of a household holder, sharing his life with his partner, who works as a geologist in the local oil and gas sector. Despite being born in the United States, Alberto's parents were immigrants from Mexico, and he maintains strong cultural ties to his heritage.\n\nAlberto holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained after moving to the state for college. He has lived in Wyoming for over 40 years, initially attracted by the state's natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities. Alberto is a US citizen by birth, born in New Mexico, but has called Wyoming home for most of his adult life.\n\nThroughout his career, Alberto worked in various roles within the financial sector, including as a financial analyst for a local bank and later as a financial advisor for a small investment firm. He decided to retire early, at the age of 62, to focus on his hobbies and spend more time with his partner. Alberto's decision to retire was influenced by his partner's stable income and the couple's modest lifestyle, which allowed them to save and plan for retirement effectively.\n\nAlberto and his partner own their home, a modest, two-bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Casper. They have no children, which has allowed them to focus on their careers and personal interests without the added responsibilities of parenthood. Alberto's primary economic concerns include managing his retirement savings to ensure a comfortable lifestyle and maintaining access to quality healthcare, given his age and the rising costs of medical services.\n\nIn his free time, Alberto enjoys hiking, reading, and volunteering at a local community garden, where he teaches gardening classes to low-income families. His economic views are shaped by his experience in the financial sector and his concerns about retirement security. Alberto is likely to support policies that protect and strengthen social security, promote affordable healthcare, and encourage sustainable economic growth that benefits local communities."
