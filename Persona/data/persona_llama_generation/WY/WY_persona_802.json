  "PERSONA": "John Thompson is a 62-year-old white male, born in the United States, specifically in the state of Montana, but has been living in Wyoming for the past decade. Despite being homeless, John is currently employed and in the labor force. He works as a part-time handyman, utilizing skills he learned during his younger years. His employment status is precarious, often relying on short-term gigs and manual labor jobs to make ends meet. John's annual income is around $25,000, which is below the poverty line for his age group in Wyoming.\n\nJohn's educational background includes some college credits in construction management, but he never completed his degree due to financial constraints. His lack of a degree has significantly impacted his career trajectory, limiting his job opportunities and salary potential.\n\nJohn has been married for over 30 years, but due to his current living situation and financial instability, he and his wife are separated. They have two adult children who live out of state and are not in a position to provide financial support. John's family situation weighs heavily on his economic concerns, as he struggles to find stable housing and reunite with his family.\n\nAs a homeless individual in Wyoming, John faces significant economic challenges, including limited access to affordable housing, healthcare, and social services. His economic priorities include finding stable employment, securing affordable housing, and reuniting with his family. John's experience with homelessness has made him more aware of the need for social safety nets and affordable housing programs, which may influence his political views on these issues.\n\nJohn's living situation is currently a shelter in Cheyenne, the state capital of Wyoming. The shelter provides basic amenities, but John hopes to find a more permanent solution soon. His economic situation and living conditions have made him more sympathetic to policies addressing poverty, affordable housing, and employment opportunities for low-income individuals."
