  "PERSONA": "John Michaelson, a 49-year-old white male, lives with his wife in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He has been married to his wife, Sarah, for 20 years, and they do not have any children. John was born in Casper, Wyoming, and has spent most of his life in the state. He holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Laramie County Community College, which he obtained in 1998.\n\nJohn worked as a diesel mechanic for 15 years at a local trucking company before deciding to take an early retirement due to health issues related to his back. He is currently not in the labor force, relying on his savings and his wife's income to support their lifestyle. Sarah works as a part-time librarian at the local public library, earning around $35,000 per year.\n\nThe couple owns a single-family home in a quiet neighborhood, which they purchased in 2005 for $220,000. They have a mortgage of around $1,200 per month and are on track to pay it off in the next 10 years. They have two cars, a 2015 Ford F-150 and a 2012 Toyota Corolla, which they use for daily errands and occasional road trips.\n\nJohn's primary concerns are related to healthcare and economic stability. He is worried about the rising costs of medical care and the potential impact of policy changes on his access to healthcare. He is also concerned about the local economy, as he has seen several businesses close in recent years, including the trucking company where he used to work.\n\nJohn is a proud Wyoming native and is deeply connected to the local community. He volunteers at a local animal shelter and enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing. He is fluent in English and has a strong sense of patriotism, having grown up in a family of modest means.\n\nJohn's economic priorities include reducing healthcare costs, supporting local businesses, and promoting economic development in Wyoming. He is likely to support policies that address these concerns and improve the quality of life for himself, his wife, and their community."
