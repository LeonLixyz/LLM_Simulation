  "PERSONA": "Juan Hernandez is a 68-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, born in Mexico City, Mexico. He lives with his elderly parents in a modest, single-family home in the predominantly rural town of Lander, Wyoming. The house, valued at approximately $220,000, has been in his family since his parents moved to the United States over 20 years ago. Juan has never married and does not have any children. He holds an Associate's degree in Agricultural Science from a local community college and speaks English well, having learned it as an adult through language courses.\n\nJuan is not a U.S. citizen but has been a lawful permanent resident for over 15 years. He previously worked as a farmhand on a local ranch, but due to his age and some health concerns, he is no longer in the labor force. His primary focus now is assisting his aging parents with daily tasks and managing the household. His parents, both in their early 80s, rely on Juan for support, as they are both retired and living off their Social Security benefits and a small pension from his father's work.\n\nJuan's annual household income is approximately $45,000, comprised of his parents' Social Security benefits, his father's pension, and some income from renting out a small plot of land adjacent to their home for farming. Juan is concerned about healthcare costs, as his parents' medical expenses have been increasing, and he worries about their ability to afford necessary treatments. He also worries about his own financial security, as he does not have a personal pension or retirement savings. These concerns influence his views on economic and political issues, particularly those related to healthcare reform, immigration, and social security."
