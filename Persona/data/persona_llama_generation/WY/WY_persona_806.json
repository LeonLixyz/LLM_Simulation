  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Margaret 'Maggie' Thompson, a retired English literature professor living in a cozy, single-story home in the historic district of Laramie, Wyoming. As the primary householder of her residence, Maggie owns her home, which she purchased in 2005 after her divorce. Her marital status as a divorcee has led her to live independently, focusing on her hobbies and community activities.\n\nBorn in Illinois, Maggie relocated to Wyoming for her tenure-track position at the University of Wyoming in 1990. She holds a Ph.D. in English Literature from the University of Chicago and has spent most of her career teaching American literature and creative writing. Her love for the American West and the opportunity to teach in a smaller, tight-knit community drew her to Wyoming.\n\nAs a homeowner, Maggie has a modest mortgage, which she has been diligently paying off since her divorce. Her annual property taxes are around $1,800, and she pays approximately $150 per month for utilities. Maggie's primary source of income is her pension from the university, which amounts to $55,000 annually. She also earns a small income from renting out her guest house on Airbnb during the peak tourist season, generating around $10,000 per year.\n\nMaggie's daily routine involves volunteering at the local library, where she helps with literacy programs for children and adults. She is an avid reader, enjoys hiking, and participates in a local book club. Her economic concerns are centered around maintaining her current standard of living, especially with rising healthcare costs and the increasing property taxes in her neighborhood.\n\nMaggie's political views are shaped by her experiences as a woman in academia and her connections with the local community. She is concerned about access to education, affordable healthcare, and environmental conservation, particularly in the context of Wyoming's natural resources. As a retiree, Maggie is also keenly interested in policies affecting social security and pension plans.\n\nAssumptions made based on the provided metadata include:\n\n- Maggie's specific age within the given range (68 years) and her exact profession (English literature professor) were chosen to fit her graduate or professional degree and her employment history.\n- The location within Wyoming (Laramie) was selected due to its connection to the University of Wyoming, aligning with her career as a professor.\n- Maggie's income from her pension and Airbnb were estimated based on national averages for university pensions and short-term rental income in Wyoming, respectively."
