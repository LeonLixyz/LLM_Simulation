  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 38-year-old divorced male living in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Ethan resides alone in a modest, rented two-bedroom apartment in a relatively quiet neighborhood. Born in Nebraska, Ethan moved to Wyoming about five years ago, seeking a change of pace and a lower cost of living after his divorce.\n\nEthan's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied automotive mechanics, but he never completed his degree due to financial constraints. Despite this, he has always been skilled with his hands and had a passion for working on cars. However, after a series of layoffs in the automotive industry, Ethan found himself struggling to find stable employment. He is currently not in the labor force, having last worked as a part-time mechanic about a year ago.\n\nEthan's economic situation is precarious, with his primary source of income being a modest disability check due to a back injury sustained in a car accident a few years ago. He supplements this income by occasionally taking on small repair jobs for friends and acquaintances, but these are sporadic and unreliable. His annual income is around $25,000, which barely covers his living expenses, including rent ($800/month), utilities, and groceries.\n\nAs a result of his economic situation, Ethan's economic concerns center around affordable healthcare, social security, and potential job training programs that could help him re-enter the workforce. He is also keenly interested in local policies that support small businesses and entrepreneurship, as he hopes to one day open his own repair shop.\n\nEthan's marital status as divorced has a significant impact on his daily life. He has no children but has a close relationship with his siblings, who live in different parts of the country. He spends most of his free time reading, working on his own car, and volunteering at a local animal shelter. Despite his challenges, Ethan remains optimistic about his future and is eager to contribute to his community in meaningful ways.\n\nIn terms of geographic implications, living in Wyoming, Ethan is aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and the impact of fluctuations in oil and gas prices on local jobs and businesses. This awareness influences his views on national energy policies and environmental regulations.\n\nEthan's political views are shaped by his personal experiences and economic situation. He is concerned about the rising costs of healthcare, the need for job training programs, and the importance of supporting local businesses. He follows local and national news closely, particularly on issues related to economic development, social security, and veterans' affairs, despite not being a veteran himself, due to his respect for those who have served."
