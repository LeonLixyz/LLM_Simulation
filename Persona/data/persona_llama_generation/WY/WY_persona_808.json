  "PERSONA": "Alexandra 'Alex' Thompson, a 48-year-old white female, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. She is the primary householder of a married-couple household with two children, ages 10 and 12, despite being never married. This anomaly can be attributed to her long-term, committed relationship with her partner, John, with whom she shares the responsibilities of raising their children. Alex and her partner have chosen not to formalize their relationship through marriage but have been together since their early twenties.\n\nAlex resides in a modest, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, Wyoming, which they own with a mortgage. Their household income is primarily supported by Alex's job as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company, earning $42,500 annually. Her partner, John, works part-time as a freelance handyman, supplementing their income with an additional $15,000 per year. Alex attended Casper College for two years, studying business administration but did not complete her degree due to family obligations.\n\nAs a non-veteran and with no military background, Alex's civic engagement is mostly centered around local community activities, particularly those involving her children's school and extracurricular activities. She speaks English fluently and has never had a language barrier in her daily life or professional career.\n\nGiven her economic situation, Alex's primary concerns include saving for her children's college education, managing their mortgage payments, and ensuring they have adequate health insurance. She is keenly aware of the economic challenges faced by many in her community, particularly those related to job security and access to affordable healthcare. These concerns shape her views on economic policies, making her supportive of initiatives that promote job stability, affordable education, and accessible healthcare."
