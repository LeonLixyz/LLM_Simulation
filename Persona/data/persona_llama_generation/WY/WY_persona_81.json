  "PERSONA": "78-year-old male, residing in the state of Wyoming, specifically in the city of Cheyenne. He was born in the United States, in the state where he currently resides, and holds US citizenship. His race is classified as \"Some Other Race\", and for the purpose of this persona, let's specify that he is of Native American descent, belonging to the Northern Arapaho tribe, which is native to Wyoming.\n\nHe has never been married and lives with his elderly parents, aged 96 and 98, in a single-family home that they own in a suburban neighborhood. The house, valued at $280,000, is fully paid off, and they have no mortgage. He is responsible for taking care of his parents, which is a significant aspect of his daily life.\n\nHe holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science, which he obtained from the University of Wyoming in 1969. Despite his degree, he is no longer in the labor force, having retired from his job as a park ranger for the National Park Service in 2004, after 35 years of service. His annual retirement income is $120,000, which includes his pension, social security benefits, and some investments.\n\nHe speaks English fluently and has no other language proficiency. He has public health insurance coverage through Medicare and a supplemental plan. Given his income and lack of dependents, he does not qualify for Medicaid but has chosen to purchase additional coverage to ensure comprehensive care, especially considering his age and caregiving responsibilities.\n\nHis economic concerns include ensuring his parents receive the best possible care, managing his investments to maintain his income, and keeping up with the rising costs of healthcare. He is also concerned about the impact of climate change on the natural beauty of Wyoming, which affects his favorite hobbies, such as hiking and wildlife watching. Politically, he leans towards policies that support environmental conservation, affordable healthcare, and programs that assist seniors and their caregivers."
