  "PERSONA": "Rajiv Kumar, a 57-year-old white male of Asian descent, born in Mumbai, India. He speaks English fluently, having worked extensively in English-speaking environments throughout his career. Rajiv is married to his wife, Sarah, a U.S. citizen, whom he met while working abroad. They reside in a rented two-bedroom apartment in downtown Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital and most populous city. Rajiv has been a permanent resident in the United States for nearly a decade but is still in the process of obtaining citizenship.\n\nRajiv attended college in India, studying business administration but did not complete his degree. Despite this, he built a successful career in the hospitality industry, working his way up from a hotel manager in India to a regional manager position for a mid-sized hotel chain in the United States. His job requires him to travel occasionally, but he spends most of his time in Cheyenne, overseeing operations in Wyoming and parts of Montana. His annual income is around $63,000, which, combined with his wife's income as a part-time teacher, allows them to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nRajiv and Sarah have no children together, but Rajiv has a daughter from a previous marriage who lives with her mother in India. They contribute to her education expenses and hope to have her visit soon. Rajiv's economic concerns are centered around securing a better future for his family, especially as he approaches retirement age. He is keenly interested in policies that support small businesses, as he believes these are the backbone of the local economy, and is also concerned about access to affordable healthcare, given his age and the rising costs of medical care.\n\nRajiv and his wife are active in their community, often volunteering at local cultural events and supporting small, family-owned businesses. Despite not being a U.S. citizen, Rajiv is engaged in local politics, attending town hall meetings, and discussing issues with his neighbors. His foreign-born status and experience working internationally have given him a unique perspective on economic and political issues, and he values diversity and inclusivity, believing these are essential for a thriving community."
