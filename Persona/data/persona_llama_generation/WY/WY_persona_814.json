  "PERSONA": "Meet 49-year-old Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a White, non-Hispanic female living in the town of Laramie, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Alex resides in a modest, one-bedroom apartment she rents for $800 a month in a quiet neighborhood near the University of Wyoming. She shares the apartment with her husband, Michael, whom she married four years ago. Despite their marriage, they do not have any children together, a choice they made due to their focus on their careers and financial stability.\n\nAlex was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and has lived in the state her entire life. She speaks only English and is a US citizen by birth. After graduating from Cheyenne East High School, Alex attended Laramie County Community College for two years, studying business administration but did not complete her degree. This educational background has still been beneficial, as it equipped her with essential skills for her current role as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company.\n\nAlex works full-time, typically 35 hours a week, and earns an annual salary of $38,000. Her job is stable, but she often finds herself worrying about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, especially the increasing housing costs and healthcare expenses. These concerns have led her to prioritize saving for retirement and building an emergency fund. Despite her financial anxieties, Alex feels fortunate to have a job she enjoys and a supportive partner.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex is keenly aware of the state's economic challenges, including the decline of the coal industry and the impact of tourism on local infrastructure. These issues influence her economic views, making her more likely to support policies that promote diversification of the state's economy and sustainable development.\n\nAlex's marital status, though married, is complex due to her husband's recent decision to pursue a job opportunity in a neighboring town, resulting in them living apart during the week. This situation, though not unique, adds to her financial stress and emphasizes the importance of economic policies that support working families and individuals with non-traditional living arrangements.\n\nGiven her background and current situation, Alex is likely to engage in discussions about economic development, job creation, and affordable housing. Her experiences as a woman in a rural state also make her interested in policies addressing healthcare access and education."
