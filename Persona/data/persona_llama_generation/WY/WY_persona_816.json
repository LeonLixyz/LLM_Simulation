  "PERSONA": "John Miller, a 38-year-old White male, lives with his spouse in a small household in Casper, Wyoming. Born and raised in Wyoming, John is a high school graduate from Natrona County High School and has always been fluent in English, having spoken it as his primary language since birth. As a US citizen by birth, John has never served in the military and identifies as a non-veteran.\n\nJohn works as a diesel mechanic at a local truck repair shop in Casper, earning an annual salary of $55,000. His spouse, Emily, works part-time as a librarian at the local public library, contributing an additional $25,000 to their household income. Together, they have two children, ages 8 and 10, who attend public school in their neighborhood.\n\nThe Millers own a single-family home in a modest neighborhood near downtown Casper, which they purchased five years ago for $220,000. They have a mortgage with a monthly payment of $1,300 and have managed to save around 10% of their income each year in a joint savings account.\n\nJohn's primary economic concerns are related to job security, as he has noticed a decline in the demand for diesel mechanics due to the growing trend of electric vehicles. He is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Casper, particularly housing costs and healthcare expenses. John's family relies on the local school system for their children's education and is keenly interested in policies affecting public education funding.\n\nGiven his background and economic situation, John tends to prioritize issues like job training programs, affordable healthcare, and support for local businesses. He is likely to be interested in policies that promote economic diversification in Wyoming, moving beyond its traditional reliance on the energy sector."
