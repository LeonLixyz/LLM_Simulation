  "PERSONA": "Emily Thompson, an 18-year-old white female, is a high school graduate and a newlywed living in Casper, Wyoming. She is married to her 20-year-old husband, Ryan, who works as a mechanic at a local automotive repair shop. Emily is employed as a part-time server at a family-owned diner in downtown Casper, earning an annual income of $18,500. Her husband's annual income is $35,000.\n\nEmily and Ryan rent a two-bedroom apartment in a modest neighborhood near the North Platte River for $800 per month. They share a 2015 Chevrolet Cruze, which they purchased used last year. Emily's primary economic concerns are saving for a down payment on a house and paying off her husband's remaining student loan debt from a technical program he attended after high school.\n\nEmily graduated from Natrona County High School with a 3.2 GPA and was involved in the school's drama club and volunteer work at a local animal shelter. She had initially planned to attend Casper College but decided to enter the workforce immediately after high school to help support her family. Emily values job security and stability, which influences her economic views, prioritizing affordable healthcare, education, and infrastructure development in her community.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Emily is familiar with the state's reliance on the energy industry and the fluctuations in the local economy due to changes in the global energy market. Her husband's job in the automotive sector is relatively stable, but they are aware of the potential risks of economic downturns in their area. Emily is interested in local politics and participates in discussions on social media about community development projects and initiatives to diversify Wyoming's economy."
