  "PERSONA": "Meet Ashley Jenkins, a 38-year-old white female living in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan, who works as a mechanic at a local car dealership. Ashley's household consists of her husband, their 10-year-old daughter, Emily, who is in the 5th grade, and their 7-year-old son, Jackson, who is in the 2nd grade. \n\nAshley's educational background includes two years of study at Casper College, where she pursued an associate's degree in business administration. However, due to family obligations and the need to support her family financially, she did not complete her degree. Despite this, Ashley has leveraged her college experience to secure a stable job as an administrative assistant at a local insurance agency in Lander, earning an annual income of $42,500. \n\nThe Jenkins family owns a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, which they purchased for $220,000 about five years ago. Their mortgage payments are around $1,400 per month, and they also have a car loan for their 2018 Honda CR-V, which costs $350 per month. Ashley and her family prioritize saving for their children's education, aiming to allocate 10% of their income towards a 529 college savings plan.\n\nGiven their financial situation and geographic location, Ashley's primary economic concerns include access to quality, affordable healthcare, especially for her children, and ensuring the local school system receives adequate funding. She also worries about the economic impact of environmental policies on the local community, as the coal and tourism industries are significant contributors to Wyoming's economy. Ashley's political views tend to lean conservative, reflecting her husband's influence and the prevailing views in her community, but she is open to progressive ideas on education and healthcare."
