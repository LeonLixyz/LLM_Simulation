  "PERSONA": "Alex Thompson, a 38-year-old White male, living in the city of Casper, Wyoming, specifically in the older, working-class neighborhood of Downtown Casper. He resides with his parents in a modest, single-family home, which his parents own. \n\nAlex has never been married and does not have any dependents. He is a veteran, having served four years in the United States Army before being honorably discharged. His veteran status has provided him with valuable job skills but limited education benefits due to his decision to pursue a career in education immediately after his service.\n\nAlex's educational background includes attending Casper College, where he studied education for two years but did not complete his degree. Despite not having a degree, he found employment as a teacher's assistant at a local public elementary school in Casper, working in the \"Education, training, and library occupations\" sector. His income is $12,500 annually, placing him in a low-income bracket. He does not have health insurance coverage, relying on the local community clinic for his medical needs.\n\nAs a non-homeowner living with his parents, Alex contributes to the household income but does not have the financial responsibilities of homeownership or raising a family. However, his financial situation is precarious, with a high portion of his income going towards supporting his parents and personal expenses.\n\nGiven his economic situation and lack of health insurance, Alex's primary economic concerns are affordable healthcare and stable employment opportunities that could potentially lead to higher income. Politically, he is likely to support policies that address income inequality, improve access to affordable healthcare, and provide education and job training programs that could help him advance in his career."
