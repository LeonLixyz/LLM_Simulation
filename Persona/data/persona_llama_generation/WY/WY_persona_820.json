  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Emily Wilson, a white, US-born female who resides in a shared house in Casper, Wyoming. Emily is a high school graduate who has been divorced for about three years. She shares her living space with two non-relatives, dividing the expenses to make the rent more manageable. Emily speaks English fluently and works as a dental hygienist at a local clinic in Casper. Her annual income is around $62,000, which allows her to cover her expenses but leaves her with limited savings.\n\nEmily's job requires her to work 32 hours a week, giving her some flexibility to pursue hobbies and spend time outdoors, which is abundant in Wyoming. She values her free time and often spends it hiking or exploring the nearby trails. Despite her relatively stable income, Emily's economic concerns revolve around affording healthcare and saving for retirement, as her employer does not offer comprehensive benefits. \n\nAs a divorced individual with no dependents, Emily prioritizes financial independence and security. She rents a room in a three-bedroom house in a moderately priced neighborhood, paying $800 per month, which includes utilities. Emily's long-term goal is to save enough for a down payment on a house, but for now, she focuses on paying off her student loans and building an emergency fund. \n\nEmily's educational background has limited her career advancement opportunities, but her experience as a dental hygienist has provided her with a stable income and a sense of fulfillment. She is proud of her ability to support herself and is cautious about her financial decisions, given her past experiences with debt. Emily's economic priorities are centered around affordability, job security, and access to quality healthcare, which influences her views on economic and political policies."
