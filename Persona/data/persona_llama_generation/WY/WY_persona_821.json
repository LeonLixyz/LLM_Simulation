  "PERSONA": "John Thompson, a 68-year-old white male, resides in the small town of Cody, Wyoming, with his wife, whom he has been married to for 45 years. John was born in Montana but has lived in Wyoming for over three decades. He is a high school graduate, having attended Billings Senior High School in Montana. After high school, John worked in various roles, including as a mechanic and later as a manager at a local hardware store in Cody. He retired about five years ago, after 40 years of working, and is currently not in the labor force.\n\nJohn's household consists of himself and his wife, Margaret, who is also retired. They own a single-family home in a rural area just outside Cody, which they purchased in 1990. The house is valued at approximately $280,000, with a mortgage that was paid off in 2010. John and Margaret have two adult children, both of whom have moved out and started their own families. Their son, Michael, lives in Casper, Wyoming, and works as an engineer, while their daughter, Emily, resides in Denver, Colorado, and is a teacher.\n\nJohn's annual household income is around $55,000, primarily derived from his retirement savings, a small pension from his previous job, and Social Security benefits. Margaret also receives Social Security benefits. John's economic concerns include the rising cost of healthcare, as he and his wife are on Medicare and have supplemental insurance, and the increasing property taxes on their home. Despite these concerns, John is content with his life in retirement, enjoying outdoor activities such as hunting and fishing, and participating in local community events.\n\nIn terms of education, John's high school diploma has served him well, but he has also taken some community college courses in mechanics and business management to enhance his skills during his working years. John's wife, Margaret, has some college education and previously worked as a librarian.\n\nJohn and his wife are proud of their children's accomplishments and are involved in their local community, volunteering at the local food bank and participating in town hall meetings. John's political views are conservative, reflecting his upbringing and values. He is concerned about the national debt, immigration policies, and the impact of federal regulations on small businesses in his community."
