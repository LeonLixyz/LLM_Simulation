  "PERSONA": "Meet 69-year-old Deborah Wilson, a retired white female living in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. Deborah is the primary householder of her single-family home, which she owns outright, having paid off the mortgage a decade ago. She has been married to her second husband, John, for 15 years, but they have been separated for the past two years due to his health issues, which require him to live in a nearby assisted living facility. Deborah is not a veteran but has a deep respect for those who have served, as her late father was a World War II veteran.\n\nDeborah was born in Nebraska but moved to Wyoming 25 years ago to be closer to her family. She speaks English fluently and has a strong command of the language, which she attributes to her love for reading and writing. Deborah's educational background includes two years of community college, where she studied business administration, but she did not pursue a degree due to personal reasons. Despite this, she has always been keen on learning and has taken various online courses to enhance her skills.\n\nAs a retiree, Deborah is no longer in the labor force, having spent the last 20 years of her working life as an administrative assistant at a local government office. Her annual retirement income is approximately $35,000, which she supplements with a small rental property she owns in town, generating an additional $10,000 per year. Deborah's economic concerns are centered around maintaining her current standard of living, especially with rising healthcare costs and the potential for changes in social security benefits.\n\nDeborah's daily life is quiet, with most of her time spent volunteering at the local animal shelter, reading, or tending to her small garden. She values her independence and is keenly aware of the economic and political issues affecting seniors, especially in rural areas. Deborah's experiences have shaped her views on healthcare, social security, and the importance of community support for the elderly. She follows local and national news closely and is not afraid to express her opinions, often writing letters to her local newspaper on issues she cares about."
