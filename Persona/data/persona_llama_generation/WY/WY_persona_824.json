  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Morales, a 69-year-old Hispanic woman who lives alone in a modest single-family home in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. As a primary householder, she is the sole decision-maker in her household. Ana has never been married and has no children. Born in Wyoming, she identifies as \"Other Hispanic or Latino\" and speaks English fluently, having grown up in a predominantly English-speaking environment. Her birthplace and lifelong residency in Wyoming have instilled in her a strong sense of community and familiarity with the state's culture and economy.\n\nAna holds a Bachelor's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in 1978. This educational background has been instrumental in her career as a librarian at the Fremont County Library in Lander, a position she has held for over 20 years. Her stable job, with an annual income of around $53,000, has allowed her to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, including owning her home, which is valued at approximately $220,000. Her monthly mortgage payment is around $800, and she pays an additional $300 in property taxes.\n\nAs a single person, Ana's household income is her only source of financial support. Her primary economic concerns revolve around maintaining her standard of living in retirement, as she is nearing the end of her working years. She is particularly concerned about the sustainability of her pension and the rising costs of healthcare, which could impact her ability to afford her home and living expenses. Given her profession and community involvement, Ana values public services, especially those related to education and libraries, and is likely to support policies that prioritize these areas.\n\nAna's experience as a long-time resident of Wyoming and her involvement in community activities have given her a deep understanding of local economic issues, such as the impact of tourism on small towns and the challenges faced by rural communities. Her economic priorities include job security, affordable healthcare, and preserving the quality of public services, particularly those that benefit seniors and rural communities."
