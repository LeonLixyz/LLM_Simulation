  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson is a 49-year-old white female, born in Montana but currently residing in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of a married-couple household without children. Emily has been married for 20 years to her high school sweetheart, John, a 51-year-old oil rig mechanic. Emily and John met in their hometown in Montana but moved to Wyoming 10 years ago for better job opportunities. Emily holds a high school diploma from a public school in Montana and did not pursue higher education due to financial constraints. She has been employed as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance agency in Casper, earning $32,000 per year. Emily's work schedule is flexible, allowing her to manage the household and care for her aging mother who lives in a nearby assisted living facility.\n\nEmily and John own a modest single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood, which they purchased 8 years ago for $180,000. They have a mortgage with a monthly payment of $900 and are struggling to save for retirement due to the fluctuating oil industry affecting John's employment. Emily's primary economic concerns are saving for retirement, maintaining affordable healthcare for her mother, and coping with the rising cost of living in their area. She values economic policies that support small businesses, affordable healthcare, and retirement security. In her free time, Emily enjoys volunteering at local community events and participating in neighborhood gardening projects."
