  "PERSONA": "Ana Garc\u00eda is a 62-year-old, white, U.S.-born female residing in a small town in Wyoming. As the primary householder, she lives alone in a modest, single-story home she owns outright in a quiet neighborhood in Cody, Wyoming. Ana has been married for over 40 years, but she and her husband, Juan, are currently separated due to his extended employment opportunities in another state.\n\nAna was born in New Mexico but moved to Wyoming 20 years ago to care for her ailing mother. She has since stayed in the state, appreciating its natural beauty and slower pace of life. Her native language is Spanish, but she speaks English less than very well, often relying on her children and grandchildren to assist with more complex communication tasks.\n\nAna is a high school graduate, having completed her education at a local school in New Mexico. She never pursued higher education due to family obligations but always valued education, encouraging her children to pursue college degrees. Her children are now grown, with two living in nearby cities in Wyoming and one in Colorado. Ana has four grandchildren, whom she is very close to, often spending weekends and holidays with them.\n\nAna is not currently in the labor force, having retired from her job as a part-time librarian at the local Cody library five years ago. Her husband, Juan, works seasonally in the tourism industry, which requires him to be away from home for extended periods. This arrangement has led to their current separation, but they remain committed to their marriage and plan to reunite once Juan retires.\n\nAna's primary concerns include maintaining her health, given her age and the remote location of her home, and ensuring she has enough savings to support herself without being a burden to her children. She is also concerned about the rising cost of living in her area, particularly the increasing property taxes on her home, which might force her to reconsider her living situation in the future."
