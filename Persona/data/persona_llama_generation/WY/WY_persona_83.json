  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old white female, living in a small, single-family home in the town of Casper, Wyoming. She is the primary householder and has two children, Emily (4) and Jackson (2), from her marriage to her high school sweetheart, Ryan, whom she married at 19 but is currently separated from due to his job relocation to another state. \n\nAlex works as a medical assistant at a local clinic, earning $19,500 annually, and has private health insurance through her employer. She attended Casper College for two years, studying to be a dental hygienist, but dropped out due to the challenges of single parenthood and the need for immediate income. Despite this, she plans to resume her studies once her children are in school full-time.\n\nAs a single mother, Alex's primary concerns are providing for her children's education and securing a stable financial future. Her household expenses are relatively low, with a mortgage of $850 per month on her modest home, which she purchased with the help of a first-time homebuyer's program. However, she struggles to make ends meet, often relying on her parents for childcare assistance and emotional support.\n\nAlex is fluent in English, having been born and raised in Wyoming, and values her independence, having grown up in a family that emphasized self-sufficiency. Her economic priorities include affordable childcare, accessible education, and job opportunities that offer a living wage and benefits. She is uncertain about her voting preferences but tends to lean towards policies supporting working-class families and women's rights."
