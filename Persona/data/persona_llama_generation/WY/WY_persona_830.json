  "PERSONA": "Meet Jessica Thompson, a 38-year-old White female living in Casper, Wyoming. As the spouse of the household's primary breadwinner, she shares a life with her partner, Alex, and their two children, aged 7 and 9. Despite not being married, they have been in a committed relationship for over a decade. Jessica was born in Wyoming, specifically in the city of Cheyenne, but has spent most of her life in Casper.\n\nJessica's educational background includes completing 11th grade at Natrona County High School but not obtaining a diploma due to family obligations. However, she has since acquired a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) certification through a local community college, which has been instrumental in her career as a CNA in a Casper nursing home.\n\nAs a CNA, Jessica works 32 hours a week, earning approximately $32,000 annually. Her partner, Alex, works as a mechanic in a local auto repair shop, earning around $50,000 per year. Their combined income allows them to rent a modest three-bedroom house in a middle-class neighborhood for $1,100 per month. They have been renting this house for five years and are currently saving to purchase a home.\n\nJessica's primary economic concerns include saving for her children's education, paying off debt from her CNA certification program, and building an emergency fund. She is also worried about the rising cost of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on her job security and the overall quality of care she can provide to her patients.\n\nJessica's family structure and responsibilities significantly influence her economic and political views. She values policies that support working families, affordable education, and accessible healthcare. She is particularly interested in local policies affecting the nursing home industry and the well-being of elderly residents. As a resident of Wyoming, she is also concerned about the state's economic diversification and the impact of fluctuations in the energy sector on local employment opportunities.\n\nJessica's language proficiency is English only, which she speaks fluently, having been born and raised in the United States. She has never served in the military and does not have any immediate family members who are veterans. Despite not having a high school diploma, Jessica's determination to acquire a certification and build a stable career has allowed her to contribute significantly to her household's income and well-being."
