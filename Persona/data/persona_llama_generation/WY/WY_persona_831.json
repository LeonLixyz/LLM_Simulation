  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 22-year-old White female, residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her 24-year-old husband, Ryan, who works as a mechanic. Alex is the primary householder of their two-bedroom apartment in a modest neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. They pay $850 in rent each month, which is roughly 25% of their combined income.\n\nAlex holds an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education from Laramie County Community College, which she obtained in 2020. She is employed as a preschool teacher at a local daycare center, earning $32,000 per year. Her job is stable, and she works 35 hours a week, with benefits including health insurance and paid time off.\n\nAlex was born and raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and has always considered it her home. She is a US citizen and speaks English fluently. Her parents, both high school graduates, own a small business in town and have been supportive of her education and career choices. Alex's husband, Ryan, is also a Wyoming native, and they met in high school. They got married in 2020 and are planning to start a family in the next few years.\n\nAlex's economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off her student loans (approximately $10,000), and building a stable financial future for her growing family. She is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to education and affordable housing. Alex and her husband are considering buying a house in the next two years, but the rising housing costs in Cheyenne are a significant concern for them. They are also worried about the impact of Wyoming's economic fluctuations, particularly in the energy sector, on their job security and future prospects."
