  "PERSONA": "Ana Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez, a 49-year-old, US-born, white female, resides in Casper, Wyoming. She is the primary householder in a married-couple household with two children, ages 12 and 15. Ana is currently married to her husband, Juan, whom she met while attending a community college in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Although they are not separated, they have been experiencing marital stress due to financial difficulties.\n\nAna speaks Spanish as her primary language but has a good command of English, which she acquired through her education and work experience. She was born in Wyoming and has lived there her entire life. Ana holds US citizenship by birth and has never served in the military.\n\nAna's educational background includes two years of college at Laramie County Community College, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree. This decision was largely influenced by her decision to start a family and the need to support her household financially. She has been working as a part-time office manager at a local insurance company in Casper for the past eight years, earning an annual income of $42,000.\n\nAna and her family rent a three-bedroom house in a middle-class neighborhood in Casper for $1,200 per month. Her husband, Juan, works as a mechanic at a local car dealership and earns $55,000 annually. Their combined household income is $97,000. Ana's primary economic concerns include saving for her children's college education and managing the household expenses, which have increased due to rising healthcare costs and living expenses in Casper.\n\nAna's employment status and income level have allowed her to maintain a moderate lifestyle, but she is concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming and the potential impact on her family's financial stability. Her family's economic situation has influenced her views on economic policies, particularly those related to affordable healthcare, education, and job creation in rural areas."
