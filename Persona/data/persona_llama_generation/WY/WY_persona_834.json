  "PERSONA": "Name: Ethan Thompson\n\nAge: 49 years\n\nSex: Male\n\nRace: White\n\nEthnicity: Non-Hispanic\n\nOccupation: Formerly a High School History Teacher\n\nEducation: Bachelor's degree in History from the University of Wyoming\n\nHousehold Relationship: Primary Householder\n\nHousehold Type: Married-couple Without kids\n\nMarital Status: Despite the metadata indicating \"Never married,\" a reasonable assumption is that Ethan is in a long-term, unmarried partnership. This is due to the household type being listed as \"Married-couple Without kids,\" suggesting a committed relationship akin to marriage but without the legal formalities. His partner, Sarah, is 47 years old, and they have been together for over 20 years.\n\nFamily Structure: Ethan and his partner, Sarah, have no children. They have two pets, a cat named Max and a dog named Bella.\n\nLocation: Ethan resides in a rural area just outside of Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital. Their home is a modest, two-story house with a small garden where they grow some of their own fruits and vegetables.\n\nLabor Force Status: Ethan is currently not in the labor force, having taken an early retirement package from the school district where he taught for over 20 years. His decision was largely due to burnout and a desire to focus on his personal life and hobbies.\n\nEconomic Situation: Ethan's annual retirement income is approximately $53,000, derived from his teacher's pension and a modest investment portfolio. Sarah, who works part-time as a librarian, brings in an additional $20,000 per year. Their combined income is $73,000, which is sufficient for their simple lifestyle but leaves little room for luxuries or unexpected expenses.\n\nEconomic Concerns: Ethan's primary economic concerns revolve around the sustainability of his retirement income, potential changes in healthcare costs, and the impact of inflation on their fixed income. He is also concerned about the local economy and the effects of tourism fluctuations on the community.\n\nPolitical Views: Ethan's political views are moderate, leaning slightly conservative due to his rural upbringing and concerns about government spending. However, his experience as a teacher and his partner's work in the public sector have also instilled in him a strong appreciation for the importance of public services and education. He is particularly interested in policies that support local economic development, improve access to affordable healthcare, and protect the environment."
