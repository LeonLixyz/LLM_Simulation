  "PERSONA": "Mar\u00eda Elena Garc\u00eda, a 79-year-old retired Spanish-speaking US-born citizen and veteran, lives alone in a single-family home she owns in Casper, Wyoming. Born in the state, Mar\u00eda Elena is a high school graduate who completed her education at Natrona County High School. She was married to her husband, a fellow veteran, for 45 years before he passed away 5 years ago, but they had no children. \n\nAs a veteran, Mar\u00eda Elena served in the US Army during the 1970s, working as an administrative assistant. After her military service, she worked as an administrative assistant in the healthcare sector for over two decades before retiring at 62. Her annual retirement income is $42,000, which includes her veteran's pension, social security benefits, and some income from a small retirement account.\n\nMar\u00eda Elena's home, valued at $180,000, is fully paid off, which helps keep her living expenses relatively low. However, she still has to manage her finances carefully, as her main economic concerns are rising healthcare costs and the possibility of needing long-term care in the future. Despite speaking Spanish at home, Mar\u00eda Elena speaks English well, which has been helpful in her interactions with local healthcare providers and government services.\n\nIn her free time, Mar\u00eda Elena enjoys volunteering at the local veterans' association and participating in community events in Casper. She remains engaged with local issues, particularly those affecting veterans and seniors, and votes regularly in state and national elections. Her primary source of news is local television stations and Spanish-language newspapers, which she reads to stay connected to her heritage."
