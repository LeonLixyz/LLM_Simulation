  "PERSONA": "Harold Wilson, a 68-year-old white male, lives in a suburban area of Casper, Wyoming, with his wife, Margaret. He is a non-veteran, US-born citizen who speaks English fluently. Harold was born in Illinois but has resided in Wyoming for over 20 years, having moved for his wife's career in education.\n\nHarold holds some college credits but does not possess a degree, which he pursued in business administration before deciding not to continue. Prior to his retirement, he worked as a store manager in the retail sector, specifically in a local hardware store, for nearly 25 years. He retired about 5 years ago due to the physical demands of the job and to spend more time with his family.\n\nHarold is now married to his second wife, Margaret, 65, who works part-time as a school librarian. They met through mutual friends after Harold's divorce from his first wife. The couple has a blended family with three grown children from their previous marriages, with the youngest child having moved out about 10 years ago. Harold and Margaret own their current home, a modest, two-story house with a backyard, which they purchased about 15 years ago for $220,000. Their current mortgage is $800 per month.\n\nTheir household income is approximately $55,000 per year, primarily from Margaret's part-time job and Harold's retirement pension from his previous employment. Harold also receives a small annual dividend from a family investment in a local ranch. He is not currently in the labor force but occasionally helps his son with his small construction business on a part-time, unpaid basis.\n\nHarold's economic concerns include maintaining a stable retirement income, managing healthcare costs, and ensuring his wife can continue working part-time without excessive financial strain. He is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Casper and the impact of local economic development projects on the community's character.\n\nPolitically, Harold leans conservative on economic issues, supporting lower taxes and limited government intervention in business. However, he is more liberal on social issues, such as healthcare and education, reflecting his wife's influence and his experiences with the local community."
