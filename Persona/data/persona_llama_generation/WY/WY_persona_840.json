  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 38-year-old white female, is the primary householder of a married-couple household with kids in Casper, Wyoming. She is married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan, and they have two children, ages 7 and 9. Emily was born in Boise, Idaho, but has lived in Wyoming for the past 10 years, having moved for her husband's job in the oil industry. \n\nEmily holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Idaho and has been employed as an Environmental Consultant for the past 7 years, working for a small firm in Casper that specializes in assessing the environmental impact of oil and gas projects. Her annual income is $65,000, and her husband's income as a drilling engineer is $85,000, providing a combined household income of $150,000.\n\nThe family resides in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood in Casper, which they purchased 5 years ago for $280,000. The mortgage payment is $1,800 per month, and they have a 20-year mortgage at 3.5% interest. They also own two vehicles: a 2018 Toyota Highlander and a 2020 Ford F-150.\n\nEmily's primary concerns are the quality of education in the local school district, the impact of the oil industry on the environment, and access to affordable healthcare in rural Wyoming. She is active in the local Parent-Teacher Association and volunteers at her children's school. Emily is also an avid outdoorswoman and enjoys hiking and camping in the nearby mountains.\n\nAs a homeowner and working mother, Emily is keenly aware of the economic challenges facing her community, including the boom-and-bust cycle of the oil industry and the need for diversification of the local economy. She is interested in policies that support small businesses, promote sustainable development, and ensure access to quality education and healthcare for all residents of Wyoming."
