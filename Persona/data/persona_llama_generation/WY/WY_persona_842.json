  "PERSONA": "Meet 68-year-old Jack Harris, a lifelong bachelor residing in Casper, Wyoming. He lives with his younger sister, who owns a modest, single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood near downtown Casper. Jack has been employed as a sales associate at a local outdoor gear store for the past five years, earning an annual salary of $43,000. His job allows him to interact with customers and share his passion for hiking and camping, activities he frequently enjoys in Wyoming's vast wilderness areas.\n\nBorn in Montana, Jack moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age. He attended Casper College for two years, studying business administration, but did not complete his degree due to financial constraints. Jack's career trajectory has been marked by various sales and customer service roles, often in the retail sector.\n\nAs a never-married individual, Jack does not have any children, but he is close to his nieces and nephews, who live in nearby towns. His sister, with whom he resides, works part-time as a librarian, and they share household expenses. Jack contributes $800 monthly towards rent and utilities, which helps maintain their comfortable living arrangement.\n\nJack's economic concerns center around retirement savings and healthcare costs. As he approaches the age of 70, he worries about his ability to maintain his lifestyle on a fixed income. He is keenly interested in local and national policies affecting Social Security, Medicare, and affordable healthcare options. Jack also closely follows state-level initiatives promoting economic development and job creation in Wyoming, as he believes these efforts will benefit his community and younger family members.\n\nIn his free time, Jack volunteers at a local outdoor education center, teaching children about environmental conservation and wilderness survival skills. He values community engagement and believes in the importance of preserving Wyoming's natural beauty for future generations. Jack's economic and political views are shaped by his experiences as a small-town resident, his concerns about aging and healthcare, and his deep connection to Wyoming's outdoor heritage."
