  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old white male, born in Bozeman, Montana, but currently residing in Casper, Wyoming. He is the primary householder of a single-family household and has been married for about five years, though he and his wife have been separated for the past year and are in the process of divorce proceedings. Ryan does not have any children.\n\nRyan is a US citizen, having grown up in the United States, and speaks English fluently. He holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Casper College, which he obtained after completing a two-year program. This educational background has been instrumental in his career as a service manager at a local Ford dealership, where he has worked for the past eight years, earning an annual salary of $62,000.\n\nAs a homeowner, Ryan owns a single-family home in a moderate-income neighborhood in Casper, valued at around $240,000, with a mortgage of $180,000 and monthly payments of $1,200. His primary economic concerns include managing his mortgage payments, saving for retirement, and dealing with the financial implications of his impending divorce.\n\nRyan's employment status and education level have provided him with a relatively stable financial situation, allowing him to enjoy some discretionary income, which he often spends on outdoor activities like hiking and fishing, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. However, the current economic uncertainty and his personal situation have made him cautious about his financial future, leading him to prioritize saving and budgeting.\n\nGiven his background and situation, Ryan is likely to be interested in economic policies that promote job security, affordable healthcare, and support for small businesses, as well as policies that address the challenges of divorce and its financial implications. His political views are likely influenced by his moderate-income status, his experience as a homeowner, and his concerns about economic stability."
