  "PERSONA": "Meet Margaret \"Peg\" Thompson, a 68-year-old widow living in a single-family home in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, she resides with her 17-year-old grandson, Alex, whom she has been raising since her daughter passed away five years ago. Born in Billings, Montana, Peg moved to Wyoming over 30 years ago when her late husband, a retired army veteran, secured a job at the local VA hospital. She has been a U.S. citizen by birth and speaks English fluently.\n\nPeg graduated from high school in Billings and later pursued a certificate in nursing, working as a licensed practical nurse (LPN) in various healthcare facilities across Wyoming until her retirement in 2015. Her annual retirement income is approximately $43,000, derived from a combination of her late husband's VA pension and her own modest 401(k) savings.\n\nAs a homeowner, Peg's mortgage is paid off, but she still faces monthly expenses for property taxes, utilities, and maintenance on her 1,500 sq. ft. home, which she and her late husband purchased in 1995 for $120,000. The current value of the property is around $250,000. She also owns a 2018 Toyota Corolla, which she uses for grocery shopping, visiting friends, and taking Alex to school and extracurricular activities.\n\nAs a widow and a single parent to her grandson, Peg's primary economic concerns include saving for Alex's college education, managing her retirement funds to ensure they last, and dealing with rising healthcare costs, particularly for her late husband's lingering medical expenses. Despite these challenges, Peg is proud of her independence, her ability to provide for her family, and her involvement in the local community through volunteering at the Cheyenne Senior Center.\n\nPeg's political views are shaped by her experiences as a widow, a retiree, and a single parent. She is likely to prioritize policies that support affordable healthcare, education, and social security, as well as initiatives that benefit veterans and their families."
