  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Carlos Hernandez, a 49-year-old Mexican-American male, born in Denver, Colorado, but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Juan lives with his 45-year-old wife, Maria, and their two children, Sofia (16) and Mateo (12). They own a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood with a moderate property value of around $280,000.\n\nJuan holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained after completing his undergraduate studies in his hometown.

His wife, Maria, works as a part-time elementary school teacher, bringing in a household income of around $55,000 per year.\n\nJuan's decision to step back from the workforce was influenced by the need to care for his children and support his wife's career, as well as manage their household finances. The family's economic situation is relatively stable, with a mortgage payment of $1,800 per month and a modest savings plan in place. However, Juan is concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing property taxes and healthcare expenses.\n\nAs a homeowner, Juan is invested in local politics, particularly issues related to education, healthcare, and economic development.
