They are paying $800 per month in rent for a two-bedroom apartment, but they hope to move into a house within the next two years. They have some student loan debt, but are managing their payments and have a decent credit score.\n\nConcerns and Priorities: Tyler is concerned about job security, as the trucking industry is highly competitive and subject to fluctuations in the economy. He is also worried about the rising cost of living in Laramie, particularly housing costs, which he believes are becoming unaffordable for young families. As a veteran, he is also interested in policies that support veterans' benefits and mental health services.\n\nAssumptions: Based on the metadata, it is assumed that Tyler's parents are likely in their 50s or 60s, and are still working. It is also assumed that Emily works part-time or full-time, possibly in a related field to Tyler's, and that they have a combined household income of around $80,000 per year."
