  "PERSONA": "Ana Moreno is a 78-year-old female who resides in a small town in Wyoming, specifically in the city of Cheyenne, in a modest, single-family home owned by her niece's family, where she lives as an \"other relative of the householder.\" Born in the United States in a different state, Ana moved to Wyoming about 10 years ago to be closer to her family after her parents passed away. She identifies as belonging to \"some other race,\" which for her reflects her mixed Native American and Spanish heritage, a blend common in the Southwest but less common in her adopted state of Wyoming.\n\nAna never married and has no children of her own. Her educational background is limited, having completed the 8th grade before dropping out to work and support her family at a young age. This limited education has influenced her career trajectory, with Ana spending most of her working years in low-skilled, low-wage jobs, primarily in the service sector. She worked as a waitress and later as a housekeeper in various hotels and resorts, jobs that were physically demanding and offered little in terms of benefits or job security.\n\nAna has been out of the labor force for over a decade, having retired due to health reasons. Her retirement income is modest, consisting of Social Security benefits and a small pension from her last employer, totaling about $1,800 per month. While this income allows her to live comfortably with her niece's family, it leaves her with limited financial flexibility, making her cautious about healthcare expenses and other unexpected costs.\n\nLiving with her niece's family means Ana has a supportive environment, but she also contributes to the household income by helping with childcare for her niece's two young children, allowing her niece to work part-time. This arrangement not only helps financially but also keeps Ana engaged and active within the family.\n\nAna's primary economic concerns include healthcare costs, the affordability of prescription drugs, and the rising cost of living, particularly housing costs, which she fears could impact her niece's ability to maintain their current standard of living. Politically, Ana leans towards policies that support seniors, such as expanded healthcare benefits, and is also keenly interested in education, hoping for reforms that might offer better opportunities for young people in her community, including her niece's children.\n\nAna speaks English well, having learned it as her primary language from a young age, and has no difficulties communicating her needs or accessing local services. Despite her limited formal education, Ana is well-informed about local and national issues, largely through television news and discussions with family and friends, and she exercises her right to vote in all elections."
