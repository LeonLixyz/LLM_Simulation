He has been working at this job for five years and is well-respected by his peers for his problem-solving skills. Ethan's work schedule is demanding, with occasional overtime, which affects his time with his daughter.\n\nEconomic Situation: Ethan's income is relatively stable, but he struggles to make ends meet due to his divorce and child support payments. He pays $800 per month in child support and has some credit card debt from his divorce. Ethan's parents provide him with a place to stay, which helps him save money on rent.\n\nEconomic Concerns: Ethan's primary economic concerns are related to job security, the rising cost of living in Casper, and the need for affordable healthcare. He is worried about the impact of automation on his job and the trucking industry as a whole.
