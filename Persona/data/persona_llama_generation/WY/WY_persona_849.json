  "PERSONA": "Rohan Patel, a 22-year-old non-U.S. citizen, foreign-born male from India, residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder of a single-person household and has never been married. Rohan speaks English well, having learned it as a second language in his home country and further refined his skills after moving to the United States. \n\nRohan holds a high school diploma from his hometown in India and has completed two years of college in the United States, studying business administration at a local community college in Wyoming. However, due to financial constraints and the need to support himself, he did not complete his degree. \n\nHe is currently employed as a sales associate at a local retail store in Cheyenne, earning an annual salary of $28,000. Despite being in a lower-income bracket, Rohan is diligent about saving money, aiming to eventually complete his degree and secure better job opportunities. His employment status and income level make him keenly interested in economic policies affecting low-income households and access to affordable education.\n\nRohan rents a small studio apartment in a moderately priced neighborhood, paying $700 per month, which is roughly 30% of his income. This leaves him with limited financial flexibility, making him concerned about affordable housing, healthcare, and economic growth policies. As a non-U.S. citizen, Rohan is also interested in immigration reform and policies that could potentially lead to a pathway to citizenship.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Rohan has become accustomed to the local culture and enjoys the outdoors, often spending his free time hiking or exploring the nearby natural landscapes. Despite the distance from his family, he maintains strong ties with them through regular phone calls and is grateful for the support they provide from abroad."
