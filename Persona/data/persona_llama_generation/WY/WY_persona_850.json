  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Carlos Morales, a 57-year-old Hispanic male, specifically of Mexican-American descent, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He resides in a shared house with two other non-relatives, a common arrangement in his neighborhood due to the local economy and housing market. Juan is married but currently separated from his wife, who lives in their hometown in New Mexico, where they were both born and raised. He is a veteran, having served in the US Army for eight years before being honorably discharged with the rank of Sergeant.\n\nJuan holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of New Mexico, which he earned after his military service. His proficiency in English is excellent, reflecting his birth and upbringing in the US. Despite his educational background, Juan is currently not in the labor force, having retired early due to health reasons related to his military service. He receives a monthly VA pension of $2,500 and social security benefits of $1,800, totaling $4,300 monthly. This income, combined with his wife's part-time job as a teacher in New Mexico, allows them to maintain a modest lifestyle.\n\nJuan's household situation is complex; he and his wife are working through marital issues, and he is currently living in Wyoming to be closer to his elderly mother, who resides in a nearby assisted living facility. He spends a significant amount of time caring for her and managing her estate. Juan's wife visits periodically, and they are working on reconciliation.\n\nIn terms of economic concerns, Juan is deeply worried about healthcare costs, particularly for his mother and his own ongoing medical needs. He also fears the impact of inflation on his fixed income and the potential for cuts to veterans' benefits. Politically, he is conservative on social issues but leans liberal on healthcare and veterans' rights. He values the importance of community and is involved in local veterans' organizations, where he advocates for better support services for veterans and their families."
