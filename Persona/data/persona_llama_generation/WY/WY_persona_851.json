  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 49-year-old Mexican-American male, living in Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder, Juan resides alone in a modest, rented two-bedroom apartment in a mixed-income neighborhood. He has been married for over a decade but is currently separated from his wife, who lives in another state. Juan was born in Wyoming to Mexican parents and identifies as a US citizen by birth. He speaks English fluently, having been raised in the United States.\n\nJuan graduated from Natrona County High School in Casper and went on to work in various roles within the local oil and gas industry. Currently, he is employed as a maintenance technician at a mid-sized oil rig, earning an annual salary of $58,000. This job provides him with a stable income and benefits but also comes with an unpredictable schedule that includes occasional night shifts and overtime.\n\nDespite being the primary householder, Juan's living situation is relatively simple. His rent is $1,100 per month, which is manageable given his income. However, he does not own a home and has no immediate plans to purchase one due to his current marital situation and the volatility of the oil industry.\n\nJuan's economic concerns are centered around job security, given the fluctuations in the oil market, and saving for retirement. He has some savings but is keenly aware of the need to plan for the future, especially considering he might be supporting himself for the foreseeable future. Juan is also interested in policies that support local businesses and workers in the energy sector, as he believes these are crucial for the economic health of his community.\n\nPolitically, Juan tends to lean towards policies that promote economic stability and growth, especially in industries that are significant to his state. He is also supportive of education initiatives that prepare the next generation for the workforce, particularly in technical fields. His personal experience as a high school graduate who found success through vocational skills makes him a strong advocate for programs that emphasize practical job training."
