  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson, a 68-year-old white male, born and raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder of a married-couple household without kids, but his marital status indicates he has never been married, suggesting a long-term, committed partnership with his spouse, whom he has lived with for over three decades. \n\nHarold's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied business administration, but he did not obtain a degree. Before retiring, Harold worked as an administrative assistant in the local government sector for over 25 years, primarily handling paperwork and providing clerical support in the Cheyenne municipal office.\n\nHarold has been a resident of Wyoming his entire life and is a US citizen by birth. He speaks English fluently, having grown up in an English-speaking household. He is a non-veteran and has never served in the military. \n\nAs a retiree, Harold is not currently part of the labor force. His annual retirement income is approximately $43,000, composed of a combination of social security benefits and a modest pension from his years of government service. He and his partner own their home, a modest two-bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood in Cheyenne, with a mortgage that was fully paid off in 2015.\n\nHarold's economic concerns include managing his retirement savings to ensure they last throughout his life, especially with increasing healthcare costs. He is also worried about potential changes to social security and pension plans that could affect his income. Harold's political views tend to lean conservative, particularly on fiscal issues, due to his long tenure in government and witnessing firsthand the impact of budget decisions on local communities."
