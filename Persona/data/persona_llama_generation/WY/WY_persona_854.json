  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 29-year-old White female, is a primary householder living in a married-couple household with kids in Casper, Wyoming. Despite being listed as never married, Emily is in a long-term domestic partnership with her partner, Michael, with whom she has two children, ages 4 and 6. They are considered common-law married under Wyoming state law.\n\nEmily is a high school graduate of Natrona County High School and has not pursued further formal education due to family responsibilities. She works as a part-time office manager at a local insurance agency, earning $32,000 per year. Her partner, Michael, works full-time as an electrician, contributing $55,000 annually to the household income. \n\nThe family resides in a two-story, three-bedroom home in a moderate-income neighborhood near downtown Casper. They purchased the home for $220,000 in 2020 with a mortgage. Emily and Michael share household responsibilities, with Emily taking care of childcare and managing the household finances.\n\nEmily's primary concerns are related to the quality of local schools, access to affordable childcare, and the rising cost of living in Casper. As a working mother, she is interested in policies supporting working families, such as paid family leave, flexible work arrangements, and education funding. Emily's economic situation is relatively stable, but the family's financial security is highly dependent on Michael's income, making her anxious about potential job losses or medical emergencies.\n\nEmily is a native of Wyoming, born in Cheyenne, but moved to Casper for better job opportunities. She values her community and is involved in local parent-teacher organizations, advocating for better resources for students and families. Emily's social circle consists of fellow parents, coworkers, and acquaintances from the insurance agency and her children's school."
