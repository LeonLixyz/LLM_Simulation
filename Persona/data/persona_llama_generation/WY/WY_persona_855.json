  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 29-year-old white female who currently resides in a homeless shelter in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She was born in Denver, Colorado, but has been living in Wyoming for the past three years. Alex is married but separated from her husband, who she met while attending the University of Wyoming, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in Social Work.\n\nDespite her challenging living situation, Alex is employed as a case manager at a local non-profit organization that provides assistance to homeless individuals and families. Her job requires her to work closely with community resources, helping her clients navigate the complexities of finding permanent housing and employment. Her annual income is around $35,000, which is just enough to cover her expenses but not sufficient to afford a place of her own.\n\nAlex's experience with homelessness began about a year ago, after she and her husband separated due to financial disagreements and differing priorities. She had been working part-time while pursuing her degree, but her husband's job loss and subsequent struggles with addiction created tension in their relationship. When they separated, Alex found herself unable to afford their shared apartment and was forced to enter a homeless shelter.\n\nAs a result of her situation, Alex's primary economic concerns revolve around affordable housing, job security, and access to social services. She is deeply invested in policies that address homelessness, job training programs, and mental health support. Despite the challenges she faces, Alex remains optimistic and is determined to rebuild her life. She spends her free time volunteering at local community gardens and advocating for policies that support low-income families and individuals experiencing homelessness.\n\nAlex's educational background has played a significant role in shaping her career trajectory. Her degree in Social Work has provided her with a strong foundation in understanding the complexities of social issues, and her experience working with vulnerable populations has given her a unique perspective on the need for comprehensive support systems. However, her current economic situation has limited her ability to pursue further education or career advancement opportunities.\n\nIn terms of family structure, Alex has a strained relationship with her husband, but she remains committed to her role as a supportive partner and hopes to reconcile in the future. She has no children, but her experiences working with families in crisis have given her a deep appreciation for the importance of stable, supportive environments for children.\n\nAlex's living situation in Cheyenne, Wyoming, presents unique economic challenges. The city's relatively low cost of living is offset by limited job opportunities and a shortage of affordable housing. As a result, Alex is keenly aware of the need for policies that address these issues, such as rent control, job training programs, and investments in affordable housing initiatives."
