  "PERSONA": "John Thompson is a 68-year-old white male, a veteran of the US Army, where he served for four years before being honorably discharged. He was born in Casper, Wyoming, and has lived in the state his entire life. John is married to his wife, Karen, and they have been together for 42 years. They have two adult children, both of whom have moved out of the state for work.\n\nJohn holds a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he earned after his military service. He worked as a financial analyst for a local bank in Casper for over 25 years before retiring at the age of 62. During his career, he was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his ability to make sound financial decisions. \n\nJohn and Karen own a single-family home in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Casper. They purchased the home in 1985 for $120,000 and have made significant improvements over the years, increasing its value to around $350,000. They have a mortgage of $150,000, which they are paying off at a rate of $1,200 per month.\n\nAs a retiree, John's primary source of income is his pension from the bank, which amounts to $60,000 per year. He also receives a small stipend from his military service, which adds another $12,000 to their annual income. Karen, who is 66, still works part-time as a librarian at the local library, earning around $20,000 per year.\n\nJohn's economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs and the impact of inflation on their retirement savings. He is worried that the rising cost of living in Casper, driven by an influx of tourists and new residents, will erode their purchasing power. He is also concerned about the potential for changes to Social Security and Medicare, which he believes are essential to their financial security.\n\nDespite these concerns, John is optimistic about the future and is actively involved in his community. He volunteers at the local VA hospital and serves on the board of a non-profit organization that supports veterans' causes. He and Karen enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking and fishing, and take advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty to stay active and engaged."
