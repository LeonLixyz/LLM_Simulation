  "PERSONA": "Emily Johnson, a 49-year-old widowed white female, residing in the small town of Cody, Wyoming. She was born in Wyoming and has lived in the state her entire life. Emily is a high school graduate, having attended Cody High School, and has always been fluent in English, speaking it as her only language.\n\nEmily works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Cody, earning approximately $32,000 per year. Her late husband, who passed away three years ago, was the primary breadwinner, working as a coal miner. Emily's employment is a necessity to support herself and her 17-year-old son, who is about to enter his senior year of high school.\n\nAs the spouse of the former household head, Emily's marital status as a widow significantly influences her economic concerns. She is the sole owner of their modest, single-family home, which they purchased 15 years ago. The house, valued at around $220,000, is located in a quiet, middle-class neighborhood near the town's central area. Emily's monthly mortgage payment is approximately $1,200, which she manages to cover with her salary and the life insurance payout from her late husband.\n\nEmily's household income has decreased significantly since her husband's passing, making her acutely aware of economic policies affecting healthcare, education, and employment opportunities in rural areas. As a single parent and widow, her economic priorities focus on job security, affordable healthcare, and education for her son. She hopes to see policies that support rural development and provide better job opportunities to ensure her son's future in Wyoming.\n\nEmily is an active member of her local community, volunteering at the Cody Food Bank and participating in town hall meetings. Her experiences as a widow, single parent, and part-time worker in a small town have shaped her concerns about economic stability, access to resources, and the need for community support."
