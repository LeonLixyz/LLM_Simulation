  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 49-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is a high school graduate who was born in Oregon but has resided in Wyoming for the past 10 years. Karen is divorced and currently resides with her parents due to financial constraints following her divorce. She has a 10-year-old son who lives with her, and her parents provide valuable support with childcare, allowing Karen to maintain her job as an administrative assistant at a local insurance firm in Casper.\n\nKaren's annual income is $82,000, which she earns working 40 hours a week. She has private health insurance through her employer, which also covers her son. Despite her relatively stable income, Karen's financial situation is precarious due to the high cost of living in Casper, which is driven by the local oil and gas industry. Her primary economic concerns are saving for her son's education and building an emergency fund to eventually move out of her parents' house.\n\nKaren's educational background has significantly impacted her career trajectory. Without a college degree, she has had to work her way up from entry-level administrative positions. However, her strong work ethic and organizational skills have earned her a stable job with opportunities for advancement. She is proud of her accomplishments but sometimes worries that her lack of higher education might limit her future career prospects.\n\nAs a single mother living with her parents, Karen's family structure is unconventional, but it has allowed her to maintain a stable home environment for her son. Her parents' support has been invaluable, but Karen hopes to become financially independent soon. She is concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming and the potential impact of economic downturns on her job security.\n\nKaren's economic priorities are centered around providing for her son's future and achieving financial stability. She is likely to support policies that promote affordable education, job security, and economic growth in her local community. Given her experience as a single mother and her reliance on her parents for support, Karen may also be interested in policies that address housing affordability and childcare costs."
