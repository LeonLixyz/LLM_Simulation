  "PERSONA": "A 38-year-old White female, named Rachel, lives alone in a modest, rented apartment in Casper, Wyoming. As the primary householder, she takes sole responsibility for the household expenses, which totals around $1,200 per month for rent, utilities, and basic necessities. Rachel is divorced, having been married for about 5 years before separating 3 years ago. She has no children from the marriage.\n\nRachel was born in Wyoming, specifically in the city of Cheyenne, but has lived in Casper for the past 10 years. She holds a high school equivalency diploma, obtained through a GED program after dropping out of high school in the 11th grade due to family and financial reasons. Despite not completing high school, Rachel has managed to secure employment as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company, earning an annual salary of $38,500.\n\nRachel works 35 hours a week, often taking on extra hours during peak insurance enrollment periods. Her job provides her with basic health insurance and a 401(k) plan, which she contributes to minimally due to her modest income. As a result of her employment, Rachel is in the labor force and is considered employed.\n\nRachel's primary economic concerns revolve around saving for retirement, paying off her outstanding credit card debt of $5,000, and affording the increasing rent prices in Casper. She has been considering furthering her education to improve her job prospects and increase her earning potential but is hesitant due to the associated costs and her current financial obligations.\n\nRachel's daily commute to work is about 20 minutes, and she relies on her 10-year-old sedan for transportation. She values her independence and is proud of her self-sufficiency, often seeking advice from friends and family on financial matters rather than relying on professional services."
