  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 39-year-old white male, born and raised in the state of Wyoming. Despite being the primary householder of his household, Ethan's marital status is listed as \"never married,\" suggesting a reasonable assumption that he might be a single father or in a long-term, unmarried partnership. Ethan resides in a married-couple household with kids, implying he may be in a committed relationship or cohabiting with a partner for the sake of their children.\n\nEthan has completed some college but does not hold a degree, which could have impacted his career trajectory. He is currently employed, working as a mechanical technician at a local equipment rental company in Casper, Wyoming. His annual income is approximately $58,000, which is slightly above the median household income in Wyoming. Ethan's job requires him to speak English proficiently, which is his native language.\n\nAs the primary householder, Ethan is responsible for a household consisting of himself, his partner, Sarah, and their two children, aged 8 and 10. They rent a three-bedroom house in a suburban area of Casper, paying around $1,100 per month. Ethan's family is his top priority, and he is concerned about providing quality education for his children and ensuring they have access to extracurricular activities.\n\nEthan's economic concerns revolve around job security, the rising cost of living in Wyoming, and the need for affordable healthcare options for his family. As a non-veteran, he does not have access to veteran-specific benefits and relies on his employer-provided health insurance. Ethan is also worried about the impact of local economic downturns on his job stability, given the state's reliance on the energy industry.\n\nIn terms of politics, Ethan tends to lean toward moderate conservatism, valuing self-reliance and limited government intervention in personal and economic matters. However, his experiences as a single father and concerns about education and healthcare might make him more open to social programs and policies supporting working families."
