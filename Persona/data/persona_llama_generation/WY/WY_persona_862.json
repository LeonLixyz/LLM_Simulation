  "PERSONA": "Agnes Evelyn Thompson, a 79-year-old Black or African American woman, lives alone in a modest, single-family home she owns in the town of Lander, Wyoming. She has been married to her husband, Harold, for 52 years, but due to his health issues, he currently resides in a nearby assisted living facility. Agnes is a retired high school English teacher, having worked for 30 years in the local school district before retiring at the age of 62. She holds a Bachelor's degree in English Literature from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in 1968. Agnes was born in Jackson, Mississippi, but moved to Wyoming with her family at a young age.\n\nAs the primary householder, Agnes manages the household finances, which include her husband's pension, her own teacher's retirement, and a small investment portfolio. Her annual household income is approximately $55,000. She is fluent in English and has no known language limitations. Agnes is a US citizen by birth and has lived in Wyoming for over 60 years.\n\nAgnes's economic concerns are centered around healthcare costs, particularly long-term care for her husband, and the potential impact of policy changes on her retirement benefits. She is also worried about the rising cost of living in her area, especially property taxes and utility bills, which have increased significantly over the years. Despite these concerns, Agnes is proud of her independence and self-sufficiency, having managed the household finances and maintained her home without significant assistance.\n\nAgnes's educational background and teaching career have instilled in her a strong appreciation for public education and social welfare programs. She is likely to support policies that promote education, healthcare, and economic security for seniors and low-income families. Her experience as a long-time resident of a rural area has also made her aware of the unique challenges faced by rural communities, and she may advocate for policies that address these issues.\n\nAs a retiree, Agnes has ample time to engage in her community and stay informed about local and national issues. She regularly reads the local newspaper, participates in community events, and volunteers at the local library. Her civic engagement and strong sense of social responsibility make her a thoughtful and informed participant in the democratic process."
