  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson, a 79-year-old, never-married, white female, residing in a single-family home in the rural outskirts of Cody, Wyoming. Born and raised in Wyoming, Agnes has lived her entire life in the state and is a US citizen by birth. She speaks English fluently and has no known language barriers.\n\nAgnes completed two years of college at the University of Wyoming but did not earn a degree, instead choosing to pursue a career in secretarial work. She worked as an administrative assistant in a local insurance firm for over 30 years before retiring at age 65. As the primary householder, Agnes owns her modest, single-story home, which she purchased in 1995 for $120,000. The home's current value is approximately $250,000, providing her a sense of financial security.\n\nAgnes's annual retirement income consists of a $40,000 pension from her former employer and $20,000 from Social Security benefits. She also earns an additional $5,000 to $7,000 per year from dividend-paying stocks she inherited from her parents. Her overall annual income is around $65,000 to $67,000, allowing her to live comfortably in her retirement.\n\nAs a retiree, Agnes is no longer in the labor force but remains active in her community. She volunteers at the local library and participates in neighborhood watch programs. Her primary economic concerns include the rising costs of healthcare, maintaining her independence as she ages, and ensuring the value of her home and investments.\n\nAgnes's living situation and economic priorities are shaped by her rural location, where access to healthcare services and other amenities can be limited. She values self-reliance and financial independence, which guides her views on economic and political issues."
