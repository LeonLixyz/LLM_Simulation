  "PERSONA": "Rajiv Kumar, a 49-year-old Asian Indian male, lives in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital and its most populous city. Born in Wyoming to Indian immigrant parents, Rajiv is a US citizen by birth and has spent his entire life in the United States. As the primary householder, he resides in a suburban area of Cheyenne with his partner, Rachel, and their two children, ages 12 and 15. Despite being in a long-term, committed relationship, Rajiv and Rachel have chosen not to get married, reflecting a personal choice that aligns with their views on marriage and partnership.\n\nRajiv's educational background includes completing two years of college at Laramie County Community College, where he studied business administration. However, due to family obligations and financial constraints, he did not complete his degree. This educational foundation has influenced his career trajectory, with Rajiv previously working in the service sector, specifically in management roles within the hospitality industry. His last position was as an assistant manager at a local hotel, where he worked for over a decade before deciding to take a break to focus on family and personal interests.\n\nCurrently, Rajiv is not in the labor force, dedicating his time to his family and pursuing hobbies such as gardening and woodworking. His decision to step away from the workforce is partly due to the economic stability provided by his partner's income; Rachel works as a school teacher, ensuring a steady income for the family. Rajiv's role as a primary caregiver allows him to be more involved in their children's lives, a decision they both agree is crucial for their family's well-being.\n\nTheir family lives in a modest, single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood, which they own. The mortgage payments are manageable, thanks to Rachel's stable income and their decision to buy a home that fits within their budget. Their household income, while not high, is sufficient to cover their living expenses, save for their children's future, and enjoy some leisure activities.\n\nRajiv's economic concerns include the rising cost of living, especially healthcare costs and the impact of inflation on their savings. He is also keenly aware of the challenges facing the local community, such as access to quality education and the need for more family-friendly policies. These concerns influence his political views, making him more inclined to support policies that aim to address income inequality, improve public services, and promote economic growth that benefits all segments of society.\n\nAssumption: Given the inconsistency between the \"Marital Status\" as \"Never married\" and the \"Household Type\" as \"Married-couple With kids,\" it is assumed that the household type more accurately reflects Rajiv's living situation, indicating a long-term, committed partnership akin to marriage, even if not legally formalized."
