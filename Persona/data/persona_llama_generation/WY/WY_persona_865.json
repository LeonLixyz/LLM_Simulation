  "PERSONA": "Meet John Smith, a 62-year-old White male, who resides in the town of Cody, Wyoming. John was born in Illinois but has lived in Wyoming for over two decades. He is a high school graduate, having completed his education at Cody High School. After high school, John enlisted in the United States Army, where he served for six years, achieving the rank of Sergeant. Following his military service, he transitioned into the civilian workforce, leveraging his mechanical skills to secure a job as a heavy equipment operator in the coal mining industry.\n\nJohn has been employed by the same company, Cloud Peak Energy, for 18 years. His annual income is approximately $65,000, which allows him to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. He is married to his wife, Karen, whom he met while working in the mines. Karen is a part-time nurse at the local hospital, and their combined income enables them to own a modest, three-bedroom house on the outskirts of Cody. The house is valued at around $280,000, with a mortgage of $180,000.\n\nJohn and Karen have two adult children from previous marriages, both of whom live out of state. However, John's 85-year-old father, a retired rancher, lives with them due to health issues. This arrangement has led to John taking on more caregiving responsibilities, which sometimes affects his work schedule.\n\nAs a result of his military background and employment in the coal mining industry, John is keenly aware of the importance of veterans' benefits and workers' rights. He is also concerned about the economic impact of environmental policies on the coal industry and the potential effects on his job security. John's economic priorities include maintaining a stable income, ensuring access to quality healthcare for his father, and protecting the interests of veterans in Wyoming.\n\nJohn's experience living in a rural area has also made him appreciate the challenges faced by local communities, such as limited access to healthcare services and the need for infrastructure development. He is likely to support policies that promote economic growth in rural areas and address the unique challenges faced by these communities."
