  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Carlos Hernandez, a 49-year-old Mexican-American male who lives in Casper, Wyoming, with his parents in a multigenerational household. Born in New Mexico, Juan Carlos has been a Wyoming resident for over 10 years, having moved for work opportunities. He is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently, having grown up in a bilingual household.\n\nJuan Carlos holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Casper College, which he obtained in 1998. He works as a Service Manager at a local Ford dealership, overseeing a team of technicians and ensuring customer satisfaction. His annual income is around $58,000, which allows him to contribute to the household expenses and support his parents.\n\nAs the eldest child, Juan Carlos has always been close to his parents, who immigrated to the US from Mexico in the 1970s. His father, now retired, was a coal miner, and his mother worked as a part-time nurse. Juan Carlos never married, choosing to focus on his career and support his family instead. He has a younger sister who lives in Denver, Colorado, and works as a teacher.\n\nThe Hernandez family resides in a modest, three-bedroom house in the Casper suburbs, which they own outright. Juan Carlos's parents purchased the property in the early 2000s, and he has been helping with the mortgage payments and maintenance costs. The household income is supplemented by Juan Carlos's parents' Social Security benefits and his own income.\n\nJuan Carlos's economic concerns revolve around job security, healthcare costs, and saving for retirement. As a service manager, he has seen the impact of economic downturns on the automotive industry and worries about the potential for layoffs. He is also concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and ensuring that his parents receive the medical care they need. Despite these concerns, Juan Carlos is optimistic about his financial situation and feels grateful for the opportunities he has had in Wyoming.\n\nIn his free time, Juan Carlos enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. He is also an avid fan of the Denver Broncos and the Colorado Rockies. Juan Carlos's political views are moderate, leaning slightly conservative on economic issues and liberal on social issues. He values hard work, family, and community, and believes that the government should support small businesses and protect the environment."
