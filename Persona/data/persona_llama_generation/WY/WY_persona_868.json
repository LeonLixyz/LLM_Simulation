  "PERSONA": "Sofia Elena Garcia, a 28-year-old Mexican-American woman, lives in Casper, Wyoming, with her two children, ages 4 and 6. As the primary household holder, Sofia is married but separated from her husband, who resides in another state due to work commitments. Sofia was born in Wyoming and is a U.S. citizen, fluent in English, having never spoken Spanish at home.\n\nSofia holds a Bachelor's degree in Elementary Education from the University of Wyoming, which she earned in 2018. Her educational background has been instrumental in securing her current job as a 3rd-grade teacher at a local elementary school in Casper. She earns $55,000 annually, working 9 months a year, which requires her to find part-time work during the summer to supplement her income.\n\nSofia resides in a modest, rented two-bedroom house in the Casper's Paradise Valley neighborhood, paying $800 per month in rent. Her husband's income is not consistently available due to their separation, and she relies on her income and occasional child support payments to cover living expenses. As a single mother with two young children, Sofia's primary economic concerns include affordable childcare, saving for her children's education, and securing stable, year-round employment to ensure financial stability.\n\nSofia's experience as a single mother and her career in education have made her particularly interested in policies related to affordable education, childcare support, and economic opportunities for women. Despite her busy schedule, Sofia tries to stay informed about local and national issues through online news sources and discussions with her colleagues and friends."
