  "PERSONA": "Meet Soo-jin Lee, a 62-year-old Korean-American woman living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is married to her husband, Jae, whom she met while attending a high school reunion in their hometown of Rapid City, South Dakota. Soo-jin was born in South Dakota but moved to Wyoming with her husband, who works as a geologist in the state's mining industry. As the spouse of the household, Soo-jin supports her husband's career, often attending industry events and managing the household. \n\nSoo-jin graduated from Rapid City Central High School and went on to attend a local community college for two years, studying business administration. However, she chose not to complete her degree, instead focusing on her family and career as an administrative assistant. She has been employed in this role at a local insurance company in Cheyenne for over 10 years, earning an annual salary of $48,000.\n\nSoo-jin and her husband own a modest, two-bedroom home in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, which they purchased 15 years ago for $170,000. They have one adult child, Emily, who lives in Denver, Colorado, and works as a software engineer. Soo-jin's household income, combined with her husband's, totals around $120,000 per year. Despite their comfortable income, Soo-jin is concerned about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing property taxes on their home.\n\nSoo-jin is fluent in English, having been born and raised in the United States. She identifies as a US citizen and is proud of her Korean heritage, often participating in local cultural events and cooking traditional Korean dishes for her family and friends. As a non-veteran, Soo-jin has never served in the military, but her brother is a retired Army officer.\n\nIn her free time, Soo-jin enjoys gardening, hiking, and volunteering at a local animal shelter. She is an active member of her community, often participating in neighborhood events and advocating for environmental causes. Soo-jin's economic concerns include affordable healthcare, education, and the impact of Wyoming's economy on small businesses and local communities. She is likely to support policies that promote economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social welfare programs."
