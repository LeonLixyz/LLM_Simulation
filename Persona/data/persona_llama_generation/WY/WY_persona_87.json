  "PERSONA": "John Reynolds, a 49-year-old white male, is the primary householder of his single-person household in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married but currently separated from his spouse. Born and raised in Wyoming, John is a US citizen who speaks English fluently.\n\nWith some college education but no degree, John has built a career as a draftsman in the architecture and engineering sector, working for a local firm specializing in designing sustainable buildings. His annual income is $42,500, which is supplemented by private health insurance provided by his employer. As a result of his employment, John has a stable financial situation but finds himself struggling to save due to the rising cost of living in Cheyenne.\n\nJohn's economic concerns include the increasing housing costs in his area, which makes it difficult for him to consider purchasing a home in the future. He currently rents a one-bedroom apartment in a moderate-income neighborhood, paying $950 per month. The neighborhood has seen recent development, with new restaurants and shops opening, but this growth has also led to increased traffic and a higher cost of living.\n\nAs someone who values stability and security, John's primary economic priorities include affordable housing, job security, and access to quality healthcare. He is also concerned about the environmental impact of local development projects and supports sustainable initiatives that balance economic growth with environmental protection.\n\nJohn's education background has had a significant impact on his career trajectory. Despite not completing his degree, he has acquired specialized skills in drafting and design through vocational training and certifications. This has allowed him to secure a well-paying job in his field, but he sometimes feels limited by his lack of a formal degree in pursuing higher-paying opportunities.\n\nGiven his marital status, John's family structure is currently complex, with ongoing separation proceedings. He has no children, which allows him to focus on his career and personal development. However, the separation has led to increased living expenses, as he now maintains a separate household.\n\nJohn's demographic profile suggests that he would be concerned about economic policies affecting the middle class, such as affordable housing initiatives, job training programs, and access to affordable healthcare. He would likely support policies promoting sustainable development and environmental protection, given his career background and personal values."
