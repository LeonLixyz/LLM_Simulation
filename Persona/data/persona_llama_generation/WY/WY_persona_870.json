  "PERSONA": "Meet Elena Garc\u00eda, a 62-year-old white, US-born female. She is a primary householder in a non-traditional marital arrangement, being divorced but currently in a long-term, unmarried partnership with her 65-year-old male companion, who is also her co-habiting partner but not her spouse. Elena's household type is classified as a married-couple without kids due to the long-term nature of her relationship, even though she is not remarried. They reside in a modest, two-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Cheyenne, Wyoming, which they own with a mortgage. \n\nElena holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which has been instrumental in her career as an Environmental Consultant for a local government agency. Her job involves assessing the ecological impact of new infrastructure projects and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. Her annual household income is approximately $93,000, with her partner contributing an additional $40,000 from his part-time work as a retired teacher. \n\nElena was born in California but moved to Wyoming for her graduate studies and stayed due to her love for the state's natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities. She is fluent in Spanish, having grown up in a Spanish-speaking household, but speaks English well and uses it as her primary language for work and daily interactions. \n\nAs a homeowner, Elena is concerned about property taxes and the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly in light of the state's growing popularity among tourists and new residents. Her economic priorities include maintaining a stable income, saving for retirement, and ensuring that her partner's healthcare needs are met, as he has a chronic condition that requires regular medical attention. Elena's experience as an environmental consultant has also made her keenly aware of the importance of sustainable development and responsible resource management, which influences her views on economic policy and development projects in her community."
