  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 22-year-old White male, living with his parents in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, Wyoming. Ethan is a high school graduate and has never been married. He is a US-born citizen, born in Wyoming, and speaks English fluently. Ethan served in the military for two years before being honorably discharged and is now classified as a veteran. He currently works as an entry-level mechanic at a local car dealership, earning $35,000 per year, which places him firmly in the lower-middle-class bracket.\n\nEthan's decision to live with his parents stems from financial considerations, as he aims to save money for further education or vocational training to advance his career. His parents, both in their late 40s, own a modest single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood, where Ethan has his own room. This living arrangement allows him to contribute to household expenses while keeping his personal expenses low.\n\nGiven his background as a veteran, Ethan is eligible for the GI Bill, which he plans to use to pursue a degree in automotive technology or a related field. This goal is driven by his passion for cars and his desire for better job prospects and higher earning potential. Ethan's current job, while stable, offers limited opportunities for advancement, and he hopes that further education will open doors to more lucrative positions or even entrepreneurship in the automotive sector.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ethan is acutely aware of the state's reliance on industries such as mining and tourism, which can be volatile. He has witnessed economic downturns in his community and understands the importance of diversifying the local economy. Ethan's economic concerns include job security, access to affordable education, and the need for policies that support small businesses and local economic development.\n\nIn terms of politics, Ethan leans towards conservative views, partly due to his military background and his upbringing in a traditionally conservative state. However, his experiences as a young adult navigating the challenges of the modern economy have also made him open to progressive ideas about education and economic policy. Ethan is particularly interested in initiatives that support veterans' education and employment, as well as policies aimed at fostering a more sustainable and diversified economy in Wyoming."
