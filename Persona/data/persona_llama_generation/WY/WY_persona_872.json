  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old white female, is the primary householder of a married couple living in Casper, Wyoming. She is married to her husband, Ryan, whom she met while attending Casper College, where she earned an Associate's degree in Business Administration. Although she is currently not in the labor force, her educational background has equipped her with skills that could be valuable in various sectors. Prior to her current status, she worked as an administrative assistant for a local insurance company. \n\nAlex and Ryan own a modest single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, which they purchased five years ago. Their household income is primarily supported by Ryan's job as a supervisor at a local oil rig, which provides a stable income of around $85,000 per year. This financial stability has allowed them to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, but they are cautious with their spending due to the cyclical nature of the oil industry.\n\nAs a non-participant in the labor force, Alex dedicates her time to managing the household and volunteering at a local animal shelter. She is fluent in English and was born in Montana but has lived in Wyoming for over a decade. Her economic concerns include the impact of the oil industry's fluctuations on the local economy and access to affordable healthcare, as she has a pre-existing medical condition. Alex's political views are shaped by her desire for economic stability, access to quality healthcare, and environmental conservation, reflecting her appreciation for Wyoming's natural beauty and her concern for its preservation."
