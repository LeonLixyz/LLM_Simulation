  "PERSONA": "Meet Kofi Owusu, a 38-year-old male who identifies as Black or African American and American Indian and Alaska Native. He is the primary householder in a married-couple household with kids, although he has never been formally married to his partner. They have a common-law marriage and share two children, ages 8 and 10. Kofi was born in Ghana, Europe, but has been a US citizen for the past 10 years. He speaks English fluently, having learned it as a second language in school. \n\nKofi is a high school graduate, having completed his GED in the United States after moving from Ghana. He works as a maintenance technician at a local wind farm in Casper, Wyoming, where he has been employed for five years. His annual income is $55,000, and he works full-time, often taking on overtime to support his family. \n\nKofi and his partner rent a three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood of Casper, paying $1,200 per month. They have been renting for three years, hoping to save up for a down payment on a house. Kofi's primary economic concerns include affording healthcare for his family, saving for his children's education, and eventually becoming a homeowner. \n\nAs a non-veteran, Kofi does not have access to VA benefits but has utilized local and state programs to help with job training and placement. His family's health insurance is provided through his employer, but he worries about the rising costs of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Kofi is an active participant in local community events, particularly those focused on environmental conservation and education, reflecting his passion for his work in the renewable energy sector."
