  "PERSONA": "John, a 49-year-old white male, resides in the state of Wyoming, where he was also born. He is the primary householder of a cohabiting couple without kids, living with his partner, Sarah, whom he has been in a long-term relationship with but has never married. Both John and Sarah speak English fluently, with English being their primary language at home. \n\nJohn holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained after graduating from a local high school in Cheyenne. He works as an Environmental Consultant for a private firm in the energy sector, leveraging his degree and experience to assess and mitigate the environmental impact of various projects across Wyoming. His job requires frequent travel throughout the state, but he is based in Casper, where he and Sarah own a modest, two-bedroom home purchased about five years ago.\n\nAs a homeowner, John has a mortgage of around $1,200 per month, along with other living expenses that are manageable on his annual salary of $83,000. He contributes to a 401(k) plan through his employer and has been diligent about saving for retirement, aiming to have enough to retire comfortably by the time he reaches 65. John and Sarah do not have any children, but they do have two pets, which they consider part of their family.\n\nJohn's economic concerns revolve around the fluctuating energy market, as his job is directly tied to the industry's activity levels. He also worries about healthcare costs, as Sarah has a pre-existing condition that requires regular medical attention. Despite these concerns, John is optimistic about the future, believing in the importance of sustainable practices in the energy sector and seeing opportunities for growth and innovation in Wyoming's economy.\n\nIn terms of political views, John leans towards moderate conservatism, supporting policies that promote economic growth while also emphasizing environmental responsibility. He is a registered voter and participates in local elections, particularly those concerning land use and environmental policies. John's educational background and professional experience have shaped his views on the balance between economic development and environmental conservation, making him a thoughtful and engaged member of his community."
