  "PERSONA": "Name: Jasmine Lagmay, a 49-year-old Filipino-American woman, living in Casper, Wyoming. \n\nJasmine was born in California but has been a resident of Wyoming for the past 10 years. She lives with her long-term partner, who works as a rig manager in the oil and gas industry, in a rented, three-bedroom house in a mixed-income neighborhood near downtown Casper.\n\nJasmine has a high school diploma from a California public school and completed two years of community college, studying nursing. However, she did not complete her degree due to family obligations. She currently works as a medical assistant at a community clinic, earning an annual salary of $38,000.\n\nJasmine's primary language is Tagalog, but she also speaks English, which she uses at work. At home, she predominantly communicates in Tagalog with her partner, who is also Filipino-American. Despite being born in the US, Jasmine's English proficiency is limited due to her predominantly Filipino-speaking household and community while growing up.\n\nJasmine's household income, combined with her partner's, is approximately $85,000 per year. They have one car, a 2018 Honda Civic, and rely on it for commuting to work and running errands. They rent their home for $1,200 per month and are not planning to purchase a house in the near future due to the fluctuating oil and gas industry, which affects her partner's job security.\n\nJasmine's main economic concerns are job security, access to affordable healthcare, and the impact of the oil and gas industry on the local economy. She is also interested in policies supporting affordable education, as she hopes to one day finish her nursing degree.\n\nIn her free time, Jasmine volunteers at the local Filipino community center, where she helps organize cultural events and language classes for Filipino immigrants. She is an avid fan of traditional Filipino cuisine and enjoys cooking for her partner and friends."
