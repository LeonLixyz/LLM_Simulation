  "PERSONA": "Meet Alejandra \"Alex\" Hernandez, a 49-year-old woman living in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. She was born in Denver, Colorado, but considers Wyoming her home after moving there with her family at the age of 10. Alex is of Latin American descent, specifically from a family with roots in El Salvador, which contributes to her being categorized as \"Some Other Race.\" She speaks English fluently and has never had difficulty communicating in the language.\n\nAlex is married to her high school sweetheart, Juan, whom she wed 25 years ago. They have two children, both of whom have moved out for college, but their 21-year-old son, Carlos, has recently returned home due to the economic downturn, making Alex a child living with parents in the current household setup. Her marital status is complex, as she and Juan have been separated for the past year but are not divorced, largely due to financial constraints and the hope of reconciliation.\n\nAlex holds an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education from Central Wyoming College. She works as a preschool teacher at a local daycare center in Lander, earning approximately $38,000 annually. Her job is stable, but the pay is modest, and she often finds herself worrying about saving for her children's education and her own retirement.\n\nThe family rents a cozy three-bedroom house in a mixed-income neighborhood near the downtown area. The rent is $1,200 per month, which is manageable but leaves them with limited disposable income. Alex and her family are not homeowners due to the financial constraints and the volatility of the local economy, which is heavily reliant on tourism and mining.\n\nGiven her financial situation and family responsibilities, Alex's primary economic concerns include affordable healthcare, access to quality education for her children, and job security. She also worries about the impact of environmental policies on Wyoming's economy, given the state's reliance on industries such as coal mining. Despite these concerns, Alex is optimistic about her community's resilience and believes in the importance of local economic development initiatives.\n\nIn her free time, Alex volunteers at a local community center, teaching English as a second language to new immigrants, a role that not only gives back to her community but also connects her with her own heritage. This experience has also made her more aware of the challenges faced by immigrant families and has shaped her views on immigration policies and social welfare programs."
