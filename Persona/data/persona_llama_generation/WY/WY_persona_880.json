  "PERSONA": "Meet Emily Wilson, a 49-year-old white female, born and raised in Wyoming. She resides in the city of Cheyenne, the state capital, in a modest, one-bedroom apartment that she rents for $850 per month. Emily has never been married and has no children. She is the primary householder, living alone in her household.\n\nEmily holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Laramie County Community College, which she earned in 1998. She has been working as an administrative assistant at a small insurance firm in downtown Cheyenne for the past seven years, earning an annual salary of $43,500. Her job involves handling customer inquiries, managing office supplies, and maintaining records.\n\nEmily is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently. She is not a veteran and has never served in the military. She is an active member of the Cheyenne community, frequently participating in local events and volunteering at the Cheyenne Animal Shelter.\n\nEmily's economic concerns include saving for retirement, as she has limited savings and relies heavily on her employer-sponsored 401(k) plan. She is also worried about the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly the increasing rent prices, which may force her to consider relocating to a more affordable neighborhood or even a different city. Despite these concerns, Emily values her independence and is proud of her self-sufficiency, having always managed to support herself without relying on others.\n\nIn her free time, Emily enjoys hiking in the nearby mountains, practicing yoga, and reading mystery novels. She is a moderate voter, often prioritizing issues related to education, healthcare, and economic development in her state. Emily's moderate stance is influenced by her experience working in the private sector and her desire to see balanced economic growth in Wyoming."
