  "PERSONA": "Meet James \"Jim\" Thompson, a 68-year-old white male residing in Casper, Wyoming. He was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, but spent most of his life in the neighboring state of Montana before moving back to Wyoming. Jim is currently married to his wife, Karen, whom he met in college. They have two grown children who have moved out of the house, but due to his wife's health issues, they are currently taking care of their 10-year-old grandson, Ethan, whose parents are going through a divorce. This living arrangement is temporary, but it has been ongoing for the past three years.\n\nJim has some college education but did not graduate due to financial constraints. He initially pursued a degree in mechanical engineering but had to drop out after two years to support his family. He has been working as a diesel mechanic at a local truck stop in Casper for the past 15 years. His job is physically demanding, but it pays well, with a yearly income of around $55,000. Jim is proud of his work and feels it's essential to his identity.\n\nThe Thompsons own a modest, three-bedroom house in a middle-class neighborhood near downtown Casper. They purchased the house 10 years ago for $220,000 and have been diligently paying off their mortgage. Their monthly payments, including property taxes and insurance, amount to around $1,200.\n\nJim's economic concerns revolve around his wife's health care costs, his grandson's education, and the rising cost of living in Casper. He is worried about the impact of inflation on his fixed income and the potential for his Social Security benefits to be reduced in the future. As a result, Jim has become increasingly conservative in his spending habits and is hesitant to support policies that might increase his tax burden.\n\nDespite these concerns, Jim is proud of his community and actively participates in local events. He volunteers at the Casper Food Bank and is an active member of the local Elks Lodge. Jim's experience as a caregiver for his wife and grandson has also made him more empathetic towards those struggling with health issues and has led him to support policies that expand access to affordable healthcare.\n\nJim's voting decisions are often influenced by his economic situation, his role as a caregiver, and his desire to maintain a high quality of life for his family. He is likely to support candidates who prioritize economic growth, reduced government spending, and expanded access to healthcare services."
