  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 28-year-old white female who resides with her parents in the suburban town of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in the state of Colorado, Alex is a US citizen and speaks English fluently. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2019. \n\nAfter a brief, two-year marriage that ended in divorce in 2022, Alex moved back into her family's home to reassess her life goals and career trajectory. Her parents, both in their mid-50s, own a modest, single-family home in a quiet neighborhood near the local community college. The household income primarily comes from her father's job as an accountant and her mother's part-time work as a librarian.\n\nAs a recent divorcee, Alex is currently not in the labor force, focusing on rebuilding her life and exploring new career opportunities that align with her environmental science background. Her economic concerns center around gaining financial independence, managing her divorce-related debt, and saving for her future. She is particularly interested in policies related to education, job training programs, and environmental conservation, which she believes are crucial for her state's and her own personal development.\n\nAlex's educational background has equipped her with a strong foundation in environmental science, but her career trajectory was put on hold due to her personal circumstances. She is now looking to leverage her degree to secure a job in the public or private sector, possibly in roles related to sustainability, conservation, or environmental education. Her current situation has made her more aware of the need for economic stability and the importance of support systems for individuals going through significant life changes.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Alex is familiar with the local economy's reliance on industries such as mining, agriculture, and tourism. She is concerned about the environmental impact of these industries and hopes for policies that balance economic growth with environmental protection. Her experiences have made her keenly interested in political discussions around education, job creation, and social support systems, particularly those affecting young adults and women in her situation."
