  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 49-year-old white female, resides in the town of Jackson, Wyoming, with her husband, Michael. Born in Wyoming, Emily is a US citizen and speaks English fluently. She holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained after completing her undergraduate studies in biology at the same institution.\n\nEmily is currently employed as an Environmental Consultant at a private firm in Jackson, working on projects related to sustainable development and conservation in the region. Her annual income is $83,000, and her husband, a high school teacher, contributes an additional $55,000 to their household income. They have two children, a 12-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter, who attend the local public school.\n\nThe Wilsons own a single-family home in a suburban area of Jackson, which they purchased for $420,000 in 2010. Their monthly mortgage payment is $2,100, and they have a car loan of $15,000 for their 2018 Toyota 4Runner. Emily's family is her top priority, and she is actively involved in her children's education and extracurricular activities.\n\nGiven her background in environmental science, Emily is particularly concerned about the impact of climate change on Wyoming's ecosystems and natural resources. She supports policies that promote renewable energy, sustainable land use, and conservation efforts. Her economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Jackson, particularly housing costs, and the need for better-paying job opportunities in the region.\n\nAs a spouse of a public school teacher, Emily is also interested in education policy and advocates for increased funding for public schools and teachers' benefits. Her experience as a working mother has made her appreciate the importance of work-life balance, and she supports policies that promote family-friendly workplaces and affordable childcare options."
