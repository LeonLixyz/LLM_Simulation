  "PERSONA": "Robert \"Bob\" Thompson, a 79-year-old retired male, living in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming, with his second wife, Barbara. As the primary householder of their household, Bob is a US-born citizen, born in Colorado, but has lived in Wyoming for over 20 years. \n\nEconomically, Bob is comfortable in retirement, with a combined household income of around $63,000, primarily derived from his pension as a retired university professor and Barbara's part-time job as a librarian. Their home, a modest two-story house in a quiet neighborhood, is fully paid off, having been purchased in the early 2000s for $280,000. Bob has a graduate degree in History from the University of Colorado and spent most of his career teaching at the University of Wyoming. He takes pride in his professional accomplishments, having published several books on American History.\n\nBob's family life is marked by his divorce from his first wife, which occurred about 15 years ago, after 25 years of marriage. He has two adult children from this marriage, both of whom have moved out of state for their careers. Bob's current marriage to Barbara, a widow, has been a second chance at companionship and love. The couple enjoys outdoor activities, such as hiking and fishing, which Wyoming's vast landscapes offer in abundance.\n\nGiven his age and health, Bob's primary economic concerns revolve around healthcare costs, particularly the rising premiums for Medicare supplemental insurance, and ensuring that his retirement savings can cover any unexpected medical expenses. He is also keenly interested in local economic development, advocating for policies that support small businesses and preserve the natural beauty of Wyoming, which he believes is essential for the state's tourism industry."
