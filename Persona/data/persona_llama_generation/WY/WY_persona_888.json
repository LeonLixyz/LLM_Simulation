  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 27-year-old White female who lives with her parents in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Denver, Colorado, Alex moved to Wyoming with her family when she was 10 years old due to her father's job transfer. She is a high school graduate from Cheyenne Central High School and has not pursued higher education due to financial constraints and personal interests.\n\nAssuming Alex is not in the labor force due to her focus on family responsibilities or personal pursuits, I've elaborated on her situation as follows: Alex is the primary caregiver for her 62-year-old mother, who has mobility issues. Her father, 65, works as a part-time accountant to supplement their household income. The family resides in a modest, two-story home they own, which they purchased in 2005. The household income is approximately $55,000 per year, with her father's part-time income contributing around $25,000 and her mother receiving a $30,000 annual pension.\n\nAlex's daily routine involves managing the household chores, grocery shopping, and taking care of her mother. She is fluent in English and has no known disabilities. In her free time, Alex enjoys volunteering at a local animal shelter and practicing yoga. Her economic concerns revolve around ensuring her family's financial stability, particularly in terms of her mother's healthcare costs and her father's retirement security. She is also interested in exploring job opportunities that would allow her to contribute to the household income without compromising her caregiving responsibilities.\n\nGiven her situation, Alex is likely to be interested in economic policies that support family caregivers, affordable healthcare, and social security. Her political views may lean towards candidates who prioritize these issues and offer practical solutions for families like hers."
