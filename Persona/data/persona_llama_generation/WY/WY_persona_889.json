  "PERSONA": "Meet Maria Rodriguez, a 57-year-old white female who has been a resident of Wyoming her entire life, specifically living in Casper, the second-largest city in the state. She was born in Casper, Wyoming, and has deep roots in the community. Maria is a widow who has been living alone since her husband passed away five years ago. They were married for over 25 years and did not have any children. Maria's husband worked in the oil industry, which is prevalent in Wyoming, and his job provided a stable income for the household.\n\nMaria is a high school graduate from Natrona County High School in Casper. After completing her education, she pursued a career in administrative assistance and has been working as a part-time receptionist at a local medical clinic for the past 10 years. Her job pays around $28,000 per year, which is slightly above the median household income in Casper. Maria's employment status is stable, but she often struggles to make ends meet due to the rising cost of living in Wyoming.\n\nMaria is a US citizen and speaks Spanish as her primary language, but she also speaks English, albeit with some difficulty. She has limited proficiency in English, which sometimes creates barriers in her daily interactions, especially in her job. Despite these challenges, Maria is determined to continue working and contributing to her community.\n\nAs the primary householder, Maria owns a modest single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood in Casper. Her house is valued at around $180,000, which is relatively affordable compared to other parts of the country. However, the mortgage payments, property taxes, and maintenance costs are significant expenses for Maria, taking up a substantial portion of her income.\n\nMaria's economic concerns are centered around her financial security, particularly in retirement. She is worried about her ability to afford healthcare and other living expenses on her limited income. As a result, she is keenly interested in policies that support affordable healthcare, social security, and economic development in her community.\n\nAssumptions made based on the metadata include:\n\n* Specific age: 57 years old\n* Specific job title and sector: Part-time receptionist at a local medical clinic\n* Exact location: Casper, Wyoming\n* Neighborhood type: Middle-class neighborhood\n* Home value: $180,000\n* Income: $28,000 per year"
