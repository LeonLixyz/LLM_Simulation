  "PERSONA": "John 'Jack' Red Bear, a 49-year-old male, identifies as White and American Indian and Alaska Native. He lives in the household of his parents in a rural area of Wyoming, specifically in the town of Cody, which has a population of approximately 9,800 residents. Jack is the youngest child and never married, with no children of his own. His parents, both retired, own the house, which is valued at around $170,000, a modest home by local standards. The household income, primarily generated by Jack's employment and his parents' retirement benefits, totals around $50,000 per year.\n\nJack holds a Bachelor's degree in Logistics and Transportation from the University of Wyoming. Despite his degree, he works as a material handler in a warehouse for a local construction company, earning an annual salary of $22,000. His job involves managing inventory and ensuring the timely delivery of construction materials to various sites around the state. Jack does not have health insurance coverage through his employer, and his income is too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to afford private insurance.\n\nJack is a US-born citizen, born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, but has spent most of his life in Cody, where his family relocated when he was a teenager. He speaks English fluently and has no proficiency in any other language. Jack is proud of his mixed heritage and often participates in local cultural events celebrating Native American traditions.\n\nGiven his economic situation, Jack's primary concerns include affording health insurance, saving for retirement, and the potential for job insecurity in the construction industry. He values economic policies that support small businesses and promote job security, as well as initiatives that make healthcare more accessible and affordable for low-income workers. Jack is also passionate about environmental conservation and sustainable development in Wyoming, particularly in the face of the state's growing tourism industry and its impact on local ecosystems.\n\nIn terms of his daily life, Jack enjoys the outdoors, often spending his free time hiking in Yellowstone National Park or fishing in the nearby lakes. He is an avid reader, particularly interested in American history and Native American literature. Jack's modest income means he has to be mindful of his expenses, but he prioritizes saving for the future and contributing to his family's household income to ensure their financial stability."
