  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson, an 87-year-old white female, residing in the small town of Cody, Wyoming. Born and raised in the same state, Agnes has lived with her 90-year-old mother in a modest, single-family home inherited from her late father. The house is located in a quiet, suburban neighborhood near the Big Horn Mountains.\n\nAgnes has never been married and has dedicated her life to caring for her aging mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. She has a Bachelor's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming but has not worked in the labor force since her early 50s, when she took on the full-time responsibility of caregiving for her ailing mother.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of Wyoming, Agnes has a deep appreciation for the state's natural beauty and the close-knit community of Cody. She is fluent in English and has always spoken it well, with a distinct regional accent. Agnes's education background has provided her with a strong foundation in social studies, history, and literature, which she continues to enjoy in her free time.\n\nAgnes's economic situation is modest, relying on her mother's social security benefits and a small inheritance from her father's estate. She manages the household finances carefully, prioritizing her mother's medical care and their living expenses. Her primary economic concerns include the rising costs of healthcare, the impact of inflation on their fixed income, and the need for affordable, accessible community resources for seniors.\n\nIn terms of politics, Agnes tends to be conservative, valuing individual freedom and limited government intervention. However, her experiences as a caregiver have also made her aware of the importance of social support services and the need for policies that address the unique challenges faced by seniors and their caregivers. She is likely to support candidates and policies that prioritize healthcare, social security, and community development initiatives that benefit rural areas like Cody."
