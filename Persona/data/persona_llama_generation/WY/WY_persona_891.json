  "PERSONA": "John Michael Harris is a 39-year-old white male residing in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Emily, who works as a school teacher, and they have two children, ages 7 and 9. As the spouse of the household, John is the primary caregiver for their children and manages the household chores.\n\nJohn was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and has lived in the state his entire life. He attended the University of Wyoming but did not complete his degree in Environmental Science due to financial constraints. Before becoming a full-time caregiver, John worked as a part-time park ranger at the Shoshone National Forest for about five years. However, he had to leave his job to care for his children after his wife's teaching schedule became more demanding.\n\nThe family resides in a modest, single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood, which they purchased with the help of a mortgage. Their annual household income is around $65,000, with Emily's teaching salary being the primary source of income. John's decision to be a stay-at-home parent has allowed the family to save on childcare costs and allocate more resources to their children's education and extracurricular activities.\n\nJohn's primary concerns are related to education and healthcare. He is worried about the quality of public education in Wyoming and the rising costs of healthcare, which affects their family's ability to access quality medical services. As a result, he is likely to support policies that prioritize education funding and affordable healthcare.\n\nJohn is fluent in English and does not speak any other language at home. He is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. In his free time, John enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and camping, which he often does with his family in the nearby national forests."
