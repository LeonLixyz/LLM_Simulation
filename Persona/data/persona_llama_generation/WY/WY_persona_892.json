  "PERSONA": "Meet Julian Sanchez, a 67-year-old male who resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As a member of a racial group categorized as \"Some Other Race,\" Julian identifies as a Hispanic American with mixed ancestry. He was born in Tucson, Arizona, but has lived in Wyoming for the past 20 years. Julian has never married and lives with his 85-year-old mother, who requires his care due to age-related health issues. \n\nJulian holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Arizona, which he obtained in 1979. Prior to his retirement, he worked as an environmental consultant for a private firm, focusing on projects related to conservation and wildlife preservation in the Western United States. Julian's career spanned over three decades, during which he worked on various projects, including collaborating with government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private companies. He retired from the workforce five years ago, at the age of 62, due to a combination of factors, including his mother's increasing care needs and his own desire to pursue hobbies and volunteer work.\n\nAs a retiree, Julian's primary source of income is his Social Security benefits, which amount to approximately $2,400 per month. He also receives a modest pension from his previous employer, totaling $800 per month. Julian's total annual income is around $40,800. He does not own a home, instead living with his mother in a modest, two-bedroom house that has been in the family for over 40 years. The house is valued at around $220,000, and they pay approximately $1,200 per month in property taxes and maintenance costs.\n\nJulian's economic concerns are centered around ensuring his mother's care needs are met, maintaining their current standard of living, and navigating the complexities of the healthcare system as they age. He is also concerned about the environmental impact of policy decisions at the state and national levels, particularly those affecting Wyoming's natural resources and conservation efforts. Julian's experiences as a caregiver and retiree, combined with his educational background and professional expertise, shape his views on economic and political issues, leading him to prioritize policies that support seniors, caregivers, and environmental conservation."
