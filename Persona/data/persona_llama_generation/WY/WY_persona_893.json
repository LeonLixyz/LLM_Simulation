  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 29-year-old white female, is a high school graduate living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with her husband, Ryan, whom she married three years ago. They reside in a modest, two-bedroom rented house in a suburban neighborhood with a mix of young families and professionals, paying $850 per month. Emily's English proficiency is excellent, as she was born in Wyoming and has spent her entire life in the United States.\n\nEmily works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance firm, earning $28,000 per year. Her job requires her to work 30 hours a week, mostly during weekdays, which allows her to balance her work and personal life. She graduated from Cheyenne Central High School and initially planned to attend a community college but decided to enter the workforce directly to support her family.\n\nEmily's husband, Ryan, is employed full-time as an electrician, earning $45,000 per year, which contributes significantly to their household income. They do not have any children yet but are planning to start a family within the next two years. Emily's primary economic concerns are saving for a down payment on a house, paying off their car loan, and planning for the future costs of raising a family.\n\nAs a couple, they prioritize budgeting and saving, allocating 20% of their combined income towards savings and debt repayment. Emily manages the household finances, ensuring they stay on top of their expenses, and Ryan handles the investments and long-term financial planning.\n\nEmily's educational background has limited her career advancement opportunities, but she is content with her current job, which provides stability and a comfortable work-life balance. She is considering taking online courses to enhance her skills and potentially move into a full-time role or a higher-paying position in the future.\n\nIn her free time, Emily enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and exploring Wyoming's natural beauty with her husband. They also participate in local community events and volunteer at a nearby animal shelter. Emily's economic priorities and concerns are centered around securing a stable financial future for her growing family, and she is likely to support policies that promote affordable housing, education, and job opportunities in her community."
