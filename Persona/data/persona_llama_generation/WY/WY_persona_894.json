  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson, a 79-year-old White female, is the primary householder of a single-person household in a rural area of Wyoming, specifically in the town of Cody, near Yellowstone National Park. Born in Idaho, Agnes moved to Wyoming 40 years ago with her husband, who she is now separated from but not divorced. She is a U.S. citizen and speaks English as her only language, which she speaks very well.\n\nAgnes has a high school diploma from her hometown in Idaho, which she obtained in 1962. After high school, she worked as an administrative assistant in a local office for about 20 years before moving to Wyoming. Her last job was as a part-time receptionist at a small medical clinic in Cody, which she left 15 years ago at the age of 64. She has been out of the labor force since then, focusing on her personal life and hobbies.\n\nAgnes lives in a single-family home that she and her husband purchased in the 1980s. The house is fully paid off, providing her with a stable and affordable living situation. She is responsible for the upkeep of the property, which she manages with some help from local gardening and handyman services.\n\nAs a non-veteran and not currently in the labor force, Agnes's primary source of income is her Social Security benefits, supplemented by a small pension from her part-time job at the medical clinic. Her annual income is approximately $35,000, which is sufficient for her modest lifestyle but leaves little room for discretionary spending.\n\nAgnes's economic concerns include the rising costs of healthcare and potential changes to Social Security benefits that could impact her financial stability. She is also concerned about the local economy, as the tourism industry, which is a significant source of income for many in Cody, has been impacted by recent events. Despite these concerns, Agnes feels secure in her current situation and focuses on enjoying her retirement, spending time with friends, and pursuing hobbies such as gardening and painting."
