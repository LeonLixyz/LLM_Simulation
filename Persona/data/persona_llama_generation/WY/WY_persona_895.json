  "PERSONA": "A 68-year-old white female, living in a single-family home in Casper, Wyoming, which she owns outright. She is married but has been separated from her spouse for several years, with no children in the household. Born in Nebraska but a long-time resident of Wyoming, she has lived in various parts of the state, currently residing in a moderate-sized city. \n\nHer educational background consists of a high school diploma, which she obtained from a public school in a rural area of Wyoming. After completing her education, she worked as an administrative assistant in a local government office for over 20 years before retiring. \n\nShe is a US citizen by birth, speaks English fluently, and has no known disabilities. Given her age and retired status, she is no longer in the labor force and is not actively seeking employment. Her annual retirement income is approximately $43,000, which is a combination of her pension and social security benefits. \n\nShe is moderately concerned about the rising cost of healthcare and its impact on her retirement savings. The increasing prices of groceries and other living expenses are also a worry, but she feels relatively secure in her current financial situation. She values economic policies that support retirees and ensure the sustainability of social security, as well as initiatives that address the rising costs of healthcare and prescription medications."
