  "PERSONA": "Carlos Hernandez is a 69-year-old Hispanic male of Mexican ethnicity, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is a divorced man who has been the spouse of his current household's primary breadwinner for the past five years. Born in Arizona but raised in New Mexico, Carlos moved to Wyoming with his current partner for her job as a geologist in the energy sector.\n\nCarlos is a high school graduate with a strong proficiency in English, having spoken it as his primary language since childhood. He has been employed as a maintenance supervisor at a local manufacturing plant, overseeing the upkeep and repair of equipment, a job he has held for over a decade. His annual income is around $55,000, which, combined with his partner's income, allows them to live comfortably in a modest two-bedroom house they own in a mixed-income neighborhood.\n\nAs a divorced man, Carlos has two adult children from his previous marriage who live in different parts of the country, both of whom are in their thirties with their own families. Carlos's economic concerns include ensuring he can continue to contribute to his household's income while dealing with the rising costs of healthcare and maintaining their home. He is particularly keen on policies that support the manufacturing sector and promote job security for older workers, as well as healthcare reforms that make medical care more affordable for retirees. Despite his economic stability, Carlos is cautious about the future, given the changing landscape of employment and the increasing costs of living."
