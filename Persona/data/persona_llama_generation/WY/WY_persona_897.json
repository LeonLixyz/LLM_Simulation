  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Hernandez, a 22-year-old married female living with her parents in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Alex identifies as Hispanic, categorizing herself under \"Some Other Race.\" Born in Wyoming, she is a US citizen and speaks English fluently, having only spoken English at home throughout her life.\n\nAlex is currently employed part-time as a dental assistant in a local clinic, working approximately 25 hours a week. Her annual income is around $28,000. She is in the labor force but has been exploring opportunities to increase her working hours or find a better-paying job to support her growing family.\n\nAlex has some college education, having attended Laramie County Community College for two years before dropping out to get married. Her husband, Tyler, is 25 years old and works full-time as a mechanic. They met in high school and got married when Alex was 20. Tyler's income is around $40,000 per year, making their combined household income approximately $68,000.\n\nThe couple has one child, a 2-year-old daughter named Emma, and they are expecting their second child. Alex's family lives in a modest, three-bedroom house owned by her parents, which helps reduce their living expenses. However, they are planning to move into their own place soon, possibly renting a two-bedroom apartment in the same neighborhood.\n\nAlex's primary economic concerns are saving for a down payment on a house, affording quality childcare for their children, and securing better health insurance for her family. She is also interested in furthering her education to improve her career prospects and increase her earning potential. Alex's political views tend to lean toward policies supporting affordable education, accessible healthcare, and economic opportunities for young families."
