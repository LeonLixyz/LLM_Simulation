  "PERSONA": "Emily Thompson, a 38-year-old white female, born in the state of Colorado but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is a high school graduate who moved back to live with her parents in a single-family home in the suburbs of Cheyenne after the loss of her spouse three years ago. Emily's parents, both in their early sixties, are semi-retired and own the home they've lived in for over 20 years.\n\nEmily works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance company, earning an annual salary of $38,500. Her job is stable, but the hours can be unpredictable, which sometimes makes it challenging to balance her work and family responsibilities. Emily's late husband left behind significant medical bills, which she is still paying off, contributing to her decision to live with her parents and split living expenses.\n\nDespite her widowed status, Emily is committed to rebuilding her life and providing for her 10-year-old son, who is in the 5th grade at a local public school. Emily's son is her top priority, and she spends a significant amount of her free time attending school events, helping with homework, and driving him to extracurricular activities.\n\nEmily's education background has limited her career advancement opportunities, but she is considering taking online courses to improve her skills and potentially move into a better-paying role. She speaks English fluently and has no known language barriers that might impact her career or daily life.\n\nEmily's economic concerns revolve around paying off her late husband's medical bills, saving for her son's education, and eventually becoming financially stable enough to move into her own home again. Her experience with the healthcare system and the financial struggles that followed have made her more sympathetic to policies that support affordable healthcare and education initiatives. Living in Wyoming, a state with a relatively low cost of living, has helped Emily stretch her budget, but she still worries about the long-term financial implications of her current situation.\n\nAs a single mother living with her parents, Emily's views on economic and political policies are heavily influenced by her personal experiences and the need for stability and support for families in similar situations."
