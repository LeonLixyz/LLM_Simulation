Her husband, John, is a freelance writer who works remotely from their home. They met while Emily was in college and got married five years ago. However, they have not yet saved enough to afford their own home. They are currently renting a room in Emily's parents' house for $400 per month.\n\nEmily's household income is supplemented by her husband's freelance work, which brings in an additional $30,000 annually.
