  "PERSONA": "Meet 28-year-old Maria Rodriguez, a US-born citizen of mixed Mexican and Native American descent, living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is currently homeless, residing in a local women's shelter due to financial difficulties. Maria is married but separated from her husband, with whom she has a 3-year-old daughter who lives with her. \n\nMaria is a high school graduate, having completed her education at a public school in her hometown in Arizona before moving to Wyoming for better job opportunities. She works as a hairdresser at a local salon, earning an annual income of $8,500. Despite her best efforts, her income is insufficient to afford stable housing, leading to her current homeless situation.\n\nMaria speaks English fluently, having grown up in an English-speaking household. She has private health insurance through her employer, which helps cover her basic medical needs. However, her financial struggles often force her to choose between paying bills, buying food, or seeking healthcare.\n\nAs a single mother and homeless individual, Maria's primary economic concerns revolve around finding stable housing, increasing her income, and accessing affordable childcare. She relies heavily on local non-profit organizations and government assistance programs to get by. Maria's experience with homelessness and poverty has made her a strong advocate for affordable housing initiatives and policies supporting low-income families."
