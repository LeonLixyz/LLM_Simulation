  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old woman living in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. She identifies as White and Native American, reflecting her mother's European ancestry and her father's Native American heritage.\n\nAlex is a high school teacher at Lander Valley High School, specializing in English literature. She holds a Master's degree in Education from the University of Wyoming, which she completed after earning her Bachelor's degree in English from the University of Montana. Her career in education is a result of her passion for literature and her desire to make a positive impact on her community.\n\nDespite her professional success, Alex still lives with her parents in their family home, a modest three-bedroom house on the outskirts of town. This living arrangement is partly due to her student loan debt and the relatively low salary for teachers in Wyoming. Her parents, both retired from the local school district, are supportive of her decision to stay with them while she pays off her loans.\n\nAs a single woman, Alex has no dependents, but she does have a strong sense of family responsibility, often helping her parents with household chores and errands. She has never been married and is not currently in a relationship, focusing on her career and personal development.\n\nAlex is a US citizen, born in Oregon, but has lived in Wyoming for over a decade. She speaks English fluently and has no known language barriers. Her annual income is $62,000, which is modest for her profession but sufficient for her current lifestyle. She has private health insurance through her employer, which provides her with adequate coverage.\n\nLiving in a small town, Alex is deeply rooted in her community. She is concerned about the economic challenges facing rural Wyoming, including limited job opportunities and a lack of resources for education and healthcare. As a teacher, she has seen firsthand the impact of budget cuts on local schools and the students she cares about. These concerns shape her views on economic and political issues, leading her to prioritize policies that support rural development, education, and access to healthcare."
