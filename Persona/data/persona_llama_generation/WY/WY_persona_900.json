  "PERSONA": "Meet Maria Elena Rodriguez, a 68-year-old divorced Hispanic woman living in Casper, Wyoming. Born in Madrid, Spain, Maria Elena moved to the United States with her family at the age of 10 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in her mid-30s. She lives with her 92-year-old mother in a two-bedroom, single-story home in a quiet, middle-class neighborhood near downtown Casper. \n\nMaria Elena's educational background includes two years at Casper College, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. Prior to her retirement, she worked as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company for nearly 20 years, earning around $35,000 per year. \n\nAs a non-veteran and not currently in the labor force, Maria Elena's primary source of income is her Social Security benefits, which amount to approximately $1,800 per month. Her mother, who lives with her, contributes around $500 per month from her own retirement savings. Maria Elena's economic concerns include affording healthcare and potential long-term care for her mother, as well as maintaining her home, which is valued at around $180,000.\n\nMaria Elena is fluent in English, having spoken it well since childhood, and does not speak Spanish at home. She is the primary caregiver for her mother and spends most of her time managing the household, cooking, and ensuring her mother's needs are met. Her marital status as divorced is a result of her husband leaving the family when her children were young; she has two grown children who live out of state and visit occasionally.\n\nGiven her economic situation and responsibilities, Maria Elena's priorities include access to affordable healthcare, social security stability, and local community resources for seniors. She is likely to support policies that address these concerns and may participate in local advocacy groups focused on senior issues."
