  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 29-year-old white male and primary householder living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Despite being listed as separated, Ryan's marital status is somewhat complex; he and his wife are in the process of divorce but are still living together for the sake of their two children, ages 4 and 6. This arrangement affects Ryan's economic priorities, as he is the sole breadwinner and is responsible for the mortgage on their modest, three-bedroom house in a suburban neighborhood. Ryan's veteran status is a significant aspect of his background; he served in the US Army for four years before being honorably discharged and returning to Wyoming, where he was born and raised.\n\nRyan's educational background includes two years of study at Laramie County Community College, where he pursued an associate's degree in automotive repair. Although he didn't complete his degree, his training has been valuable in his current role as a mechanic at a local car dealership, where he earns a salary of $52,000 per year. His job provides health insurance for his family, which is crucial given the high cost of living in Wyoming.\n\nRyan's primary concerns are providing for his children's education and saving for their future, as well as managing the financial strain of an impending divorce. He is particularly interested in policies related to affordable housing, education, and veterans' benefits, as these issues directly impact his life and the well-being of his family."
