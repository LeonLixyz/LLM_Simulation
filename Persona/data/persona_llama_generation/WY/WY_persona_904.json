  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 49-year-old white female living in a single-family home with her parents in Casper, Wyoming. She is divorced with no children. \n\nAlex's education background includes two years of study at Casper College, where she pursued an associate's degree in business administration but did not graduate due to financial constraints. This educational foundation has been beneficial in her career, as she currently works as an administrative assistant at a local insurance agency in Casper, earning $38,500 per year.\n\nAs a divorced individual, Alex's economic situation is relatively stable, thanks to her steady employment and the support of her parents, with whom she resides. She contributes to the household income, helping with mortgage payments on the family home, which is valued at $220,000. Her parents, both retired, own the home outright, having paid off the mortgage years ago.\n\nAlex's daily commute is approximately 20 minutes, as she drives to work. She owns a 2018 Honda Civic, which she purchased used in 2020 for $18,000. Her monthly expenses include a $300 car loan payment, $150 for car insurance, and $100 for gasoline.\n\nAlex's economic concerns include saving for retirement, as her employer does not offer a 401(k) matching program, and she has limited savings. She also worries about potential job insecurity, given the economic fluctuations in Wyoming's energy industry, which affects local businesses, including her employer.\n\nIn her free time, Alex enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. She is an avid reader and participates in a local book club. Her social life is relatively quiet, with most of her interactions being with family, coworkers, and close friends.\n\nAlex's living situation with her parents allows her to maintain a comfortable lifestyle while managing her expenses carefully. Her economic priorities focus on long-term financial security and stability, influencing her views on local and national economic policies."
