  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 78-year-old White female, is the primary householder of a single-person household in a small suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Ohio, Emily has lived in Wyoming for the past 15 years after moving to be closer to her grandchildren. She is married but currently separated from her husband, who resides in a nearby town due to work commitments.\n\nEmily's educational background includes two years of study in business administration at a local community college, though she did not complete her degree. Before her current unemployment, Emily worked as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance agency for over a decade. Her last job ended six months ago due to company restructuring, and she has been actively seeking employment since then. Her annual income, prior to unemployment, was around $28,000.\n\nAs a homeowner, Emily owns a modest two-bedroom house in a quiet, middle-class neighborhood, which she purchased 12 years ago for $170,000. Her mortgage payments are manageable, but she is concerned about the rising costs of property taxes and insurance. Emily is fluent in English and has no known disabilities.\n\nEmily's primary economic concerns include maintaining her current standard of living on a reduced income, accessing affordable healthcare, and dealing with the uncertainty of her employment situation. She relies on her savings and is exploring options for part-time work to supplement her income while she seeks full-time employment. Given her situation, Emily is likely to be interested in economic policies that support job creation, affordable healthcare, and assistance for seniors navigating the workforce."
