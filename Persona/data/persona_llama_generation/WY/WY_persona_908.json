  "PERSONA": "Meet 22-year-old Ethan Thompson, a white male living with his parents in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. Ethan was born and raised in Wyoming and has never married. He recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming in Laramie, the state's largest city. Although he is not currently in the labor force, Ethan has been actively applying for jobs in the environmental sector, leveraging his degree and volunteer experience in conservation projects during his college years. \n\nEthan's proficiency in English, as the only language he speaks, has not limited his opportunities, given the predominantly English-speaking environment in Wyoming. As a non-veteran, Ethan's focus remains on transitioning into a career that aligns with his educational background and personal interests.\n\nEthan's household situation, living with his parents, is a temporary arrangement as he navigates the job market. His parents, both high school graduates, own their home, which they have lived in for over 20 years. This stable family environment has provided Ethan with a comfortable living situation, allowing him to focus on his education and job search without immediate financial burdens.\n\nEthan's economic concerns revolve around securing a job that matches his educational qualifications and finding affordable housing should he decide to move out of his parents' home. Given the relatively low cost of living in Wyoming, Ethan is optimistic about his prospects. However, he is aware of the challenges of finding employment in his field in a state with a relatively small job market.\n\nEthan's educational background and interests in environmental science influence his political views, with a focus on conservation policies and sustainable development. Living in Wyoming, a state heavily reliant on the energy sector, Ethan's views may diverge from some of his community's economic priorities, making his voice an important one in local discussions about the future of the state's economy."
