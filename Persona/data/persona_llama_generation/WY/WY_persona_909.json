  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson, a 22-year-old White female, is the primary householder of a married-couple household with kids in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Given her marital status is listed as \"Widowed,\" it is assumed that Emily's spouse passed away, likely at a young age, and she is now the sole breadwinner for her family.\n\nEmily was born in Wyoming, specifically in the city of Cheyenne, where she still resides. She speaks English fluently and has been a US citizen since birth. Emily's household consists of herself and her two children, aged 3 and 5. She rents a modest, three-bedroom apartment in a suburban neighborhood for $900 per month.\n\nEmily attended Laramie County Community College for two years, pursuing an associate's degree in early childhood education, but did not complete her degree due to her spouse's passing and the subsequent need to focus on raising her children. Despite this, Emily secured a job as a preschool teacher's assistant at a local daycare center, earning $28,000 per year. She works 35 hours a week, which allows her to balance her job and childcare responsibilities.\n\nAs a single parent, Emily's primary economic concerns include affording quality childcare, paying off her student loans (which total $10,000), and saving for her children's future education expenses. She is also worried about healthcare costs, as she struggles to afford adequate health insurance coverage for her family.\n\nEmily's family relies on her income, and she often has to make difficult financial decisions to ensure they can make ends meet. She has had to forego her own education and career advancement goals to prioritize her family's needs. As a result, Emily is likely to support policies that address affordable childcare, education, and healthcare, as well as initiatives that provide economic assistance to single-parent households."
