  "PERSONA": "Meet Harold Thompson, a 68-year-old white male living in the picturesque town of Lander, Wyoming. He resides with his 92-year-old mother, Edna, in a cozy, single-story home they own on the outskirts of town. Harold is married to his wife, Karen, 66, whom he met in high school but married later in life after reconnecting at a high school reunion. They have no children together, but Harold has a close relationship with his nieces and nephews from his sister's family.\n\nHarold was born in Billings, Montana, but his family moved to Wyoming when he was a teenager. He attended the local high school in Lander, where he developed a passion for mechanics and the outdoors. After high school, he attended Casper College for two years, studying automotive technology but did not complete his degree due to family obligations. He worked as an auto mechanic in various shops in the region for over three decades before deciding to retire early due to health concerns.\n\nAs a retiree, Harold's annual income is approximately $45,000, mostly from his pension and some investments he made over the years. His wife, Karen, supplements their income with part-time work as a librarian at the local library, earning around $18,000 annually. They own their home, valued at $220,000, and have a modest mortgage of $80,000.\n\nHarold's primary economic concerns are healthcare costs, particularly long-term care for his mother, who requires assistance with daily activities. He is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, especially the increasing prices of fuel and groceries. Despite these concerns, Harold feels relatively secure in his retirement, thanks to his pension and the support of his wife.\n\nIn his free time, Harold enjoys tinkering with his classic Ford truck, fishing in the nearby lakes, and volunteering at the local animal shelter. He is a proud member of the Lander community and participates in town hall meetings, where he often expresses his views on issues affecting local businesses and the environment."
