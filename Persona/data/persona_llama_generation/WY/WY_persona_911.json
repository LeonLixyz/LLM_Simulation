  "PERSONA": "Elena Hern\u00e1ndez, a 79-year-old Spanish-speaking, white, US-born woman living in a small town in Wyoming. She has been married to her husband, John, for 55 years, and they reside in a modest, single-story house they own in a quiet neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital city. Elena's primary language is Spanish, but she speaks some English, though not fluently. She was born in Wyoming, where her family has lived for generations.\n\nElena's educational background includes two years at Laramie County Community College, where she studied early childhood education. However, she did not complete her degree due to family obligations. Before leaving the workforce, Elena worked as a part-time preschool teacher's assistant for 15 years, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Her decision to stop working was largely influenced by her desire to care for her grandchildren and help her husband with their small family farm.\n\nElena's household income is primarily based on her husband's pension from his work as a retired mechanic and her own Social Security benefits. Their combined annual income is approximately $55,000, which allows them to live comfortably, albeit modestly. They have two grown children, both of whom live in the same town and often visit. Their children are both married, and Elena has four grandchildren.\n\nGiven her age and health, Elena's primary economic concerns revolve around healthcare costs, particularly the affordability of medications and potential long-term care. She is also concerned about the rising costs of living, especially the increasing prices of groceries and utilities, which affect her household budget. Elena and her husband are proud homeowners, having paid off their mortgage 10 years ago. They value their independence and the comfort of knowing they have a secure place to live.\n\nPolitically, Elena's views are shaped by her conservative upbringing and her concerns about the economy and healthcare. She values government programs that support seniors, such as Social Security and Medicare, and is cautious about changes to these programs. Elena does not actively participate in politics but votes in local and national elections, often influenced by her husband's opinions and the advice of her children."
