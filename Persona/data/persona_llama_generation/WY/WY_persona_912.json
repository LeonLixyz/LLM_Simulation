  "PERSONA": "Name: Derek Thompson\n\nDerek is a 49-year-old White male who resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He lives with his wife, Sarah, and her two children from a previous marriage, for whom Derek has been a stepfather for the past 7 years. They reside in a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom house that Derek and his wife purchased 5 years ago for $280,000, with a current mortgage of $1,800 per month. Derek's household situation is that of an 'Other Relative of Householder' due to initially moving in with his then-girlfriend (now wife) who was the primary homeowner.\n\nBorn in Montana, Derek moved to Wyoming 10 years ago for job opportunities. He is a US citizen by birth and has never served in the military. Derek speaks fluent English, which is his primary language, but he also understands some German, which he learned from his grandparents.\n\nDerek is a high school graduate with some college education but no degree. He attended Casper College for two years, studying business administration but did not complete his degree due to financial constraints. This educational background has slightly limited his career advancement, but he has managed to secure a stable job.\n\nProfessionally, Derek works as a Sales Representative for a local agricultural equipment supplier, earning an annual salary of $62,000. His job requires him to travel across Wyoming and occasionally to neighboring states, which he enjoys as it allows him to explore new places. Derek has been with his current employer for 8 years and feels secure in his position but wishes he could find a role that would allow him to utilize his college education more effectively.\n\nDerek and his wife have a combined household income of $92,000. Besides the mortgage, their main expenses include a car loan for their 2018 Toyota 4Runner ($450/month), health insurance ($300/month), and saving for their children's college funds. Derek is concerned about the rising costs of living, especially healthcare, and the impact of economic downturns on his job security.\n\nIn terms of economic and political views, Derek is conservative, favoring policies that support local businesses and job creation. He is also concerned about environmental issues, particularly those affecting Wyoming's natural landscapes and wildlife, given his love for outdoor activities like hunting and fishing. Derek votes regularly in local and national elections and is keenly interested in policies that affect his community and family directly."
