  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson is a 48-year-old white female, born in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming, where she has lived for most of her life. She holds a graduate degree in Social Work from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained 15 years ago. Despite her educational background, Emily is currently not in the labor force, largely due to her current situation of being homeless. This is a recent development, as she and her husband, John, were forced to leave their rented home due to a combination of factors, including a significant increase in rent and John's job loss. They have been living in a homeless shelter in Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital and largest city, for the past six months.\n\nEmily is now married, except separated, as she and John are currently living apart due to the shelter's policy of separating couples. They have two children, ages 10 and 12, who are living with Emily's sister in a nearby town until the family can get back on their feet. Emily's family situation and her current living conditions are her primary concerns, influencing her economic and political views, especially regarding affordable housing, social welfare programs, and job creation initiatives.\n\nEmily's educational background has equipped her with a strong understanding of social and economic issues, but her current situation has given her a firsthand experience of the challenges faced by those in need. Her economic priorities include stable housing, access to healthcare for her family, and job opportunities that can support her family's well-being. Despite the challenges, Emily remains hopeful and is actively seeking job opportunities and resources to help her family regain stability."
