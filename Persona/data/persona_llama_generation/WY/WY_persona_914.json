  "PERSONA": "Meet Karen Thompson, a 57-year-old female, born in the United States, specifically in the state of Oregon, but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She identifies as White and American Indian, reflecting her mixed heritage from her mother's side, who was of Cherokee descent. Karen is married to her high school sweetheart, John, and they have been together for 35 years. \n\nKaren holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Oregon, which she obtained in 1989. After graduating, she worked as an environmental consultant for various firms before transitioning into a role as a project manager for a local non-profit organization focused on conservation efforts in Wyoming. She has been in her current position for over a decade, earning an annual salary of $68,000. Her job involves overseeing projects that aim to preserve Wyoming's natural beauty and wildlife, aligning with her passion for environmental protection.\n\nKaren and her husband own a single-family home in a suburban area of Cheyenne, valued at approximately $280,000. They have two grown children who are now independent; their son works as a software engineer in Denver, Colorado, and their daughter is a graduate student in California. This has allowed Karen and John to downsize their household expenses and focus on saving for retirement.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Karen is keenly aware of the state's reliance on the energy industry and the impact of economic fluctuations on the local community. Her primary economic concerns include the sustainability of her job sector, given the political climate surrounding environmental policies, and the rising costs of healthcare, especially as she and her husband approach retirement age. She supports policies that promote renewable energy, protect public lands, and ensure affordable healthcare for all Americans.\n\nKaren's educational background and career trajectory have instilled in her a strong appreciation for science-based decision-making and community engagement. She is fluent in English and values clear communication in both her personal and professional life. As a spouse of a household member who also works full-time (John is a high school teacher), Karen's household income is approximately $110,000 per year, placing them in a comfortable middle-class position. However, she remains mindful of the economic uncertainties and is actively planning for the future to ensure a secure retirement."
