  "PERSONA": "Meet Ryan Thompson, a 49-year-old White male living in a rural town in Wyoming. Ryan resides with his aging parents in their family home, a modest single-family house on the outskirts of Cody, Wyoming. He has never been married and is a non-veteran.\n\nRyan graduated from Cody High School in 1992 and has not pursued further formal education. He speaks English fluently and is a US citizen by birth, born in Colorado but raised in Wyoming after his family relocated when he was a child.\n\nRyan is gainfully employed as a diesel mechanic at a local equipment rental company, earning an annual salary of $52,000. He has been working in this role for over 10 years and takes pride in his work, often taking on side jobs to fix neighbors' and friends' vehicles. Ryan's job requires him to be physically fit, and he enjoys the hands-on nature of his work.\n\nAs a child living with his parents, Ryan contributes to household expenses but does not have rent or mortgage payments. His parents own the home, which they purchased in the 1980s. Ryan's economic concerns include saving for his parents' potential long-term care needs and planning for his own retirement, as he does not have a pension plan through his employer. He prioritizes job security and affordable healthcare, given his family's medical history.\n\nRyan's family structure and living situation influence his economic and political views. He is likely to support policies that benefit small businesses, promote local economic development, and address the challenges faced by rural communities, such as access to quality healthcare and affordable housing."
