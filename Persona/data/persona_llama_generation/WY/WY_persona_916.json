  "PERSONA": "Meet Maria Elena Hernandez, a 29-year-old Mexican-American woman living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. She is the youngest child of a tight-knit family and resides with her parents, Carlos and Elena, in a cozy three-bedroom house on the west side of town. Maria's marital status as a widow is a result of her husband's tragic passing in a car accident two years ago, when she was just 27. They were married for three years and did not have any children.\n\nMaria graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, where she developed strong skills in accounting and financial management. She is currently employed as an Accountant at a mid-sized firm in Cheyenne, earning $52,000 per year. Her job requires her to be proficient in English, which she speaks fluently, having been born and raised in the United States.\n\nGrowing up in a predominantly Hispanic household, Maria's parents, both US-born citizens, emphasized the importance of education and cultural heritage. Her father, Carlos, works as a rancher, and her mother, Elena, is a part-time teacher at a local elementary school. Maria's experience living with her parents has allowed her to save on living expenses and allocate a significant portion of her income towards paying off her student loans and building an emergency fund.\n\nMaria's economic concerns center around financial security and stability, particularly in light of her recent loss. She is eager to continue growing in her career, potentially pursuing a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) certification, and eventually becoming financially independent. Her experience as a young widow has also made her acutely aware of the importance of social safety nets and access to affordable healthcare.\n\nIn her free time, Maria enjoys volunteering at local community events, practicing yoga, and exploring the outdoors. She is proud of her Mexican heritage and actively participates in cultural events and festivals in Cheyenne, which has a small but vibrant Hispanic community. Maria's strong family ties, cultural roots, and personal resilience shape her economic and political views, as she navigates her life as a young widow in a predominantly rural state."
