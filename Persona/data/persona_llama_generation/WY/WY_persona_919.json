She holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, obtained in 1985. Emilia is a US-born citizen, fluent in English, and has never served in the military.\n\nEmilia's current marital status is married, but her husband, a retired park ranger, has been living in a nearby care facility due to early-onset Alzheimer's. They have no children together, and Emilia has dedicated her life to caring for her parents, who are both in their late 80s and require full-time assistance.\n\nEmilia's household income is approximately $40,000 per year, primarily composed of her husband's pension and her parents' social security benefits.

She is also concerned about the impact of climate change on Wyoming's natural resources and the local economy. Emilia's educational background and professional experience have instilled in her a strong appreciation for environmental conservation, and she is likely to support policies that prioritize sustainability and protect the state's natural heritage.\n\nEmilia's living situation, with her parents and husband requiring care, makes her particularly interested in healthcare and social services. She is likely to support policies that improve access to affordable healthcare, especially for seniors and those with chronic conditions. Emilia's experience as a caregiver also makes her aware of the importance of social support systems and respite care services.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, Emilia is likely to support initiatives that promote local economic growth, particularly in the tourism and outdoor recreation sectors, which are vital to Wyoming's economy. She may also be interested in policies that address the state's brain drain and encourage young professionals to stay in Wyoming."
