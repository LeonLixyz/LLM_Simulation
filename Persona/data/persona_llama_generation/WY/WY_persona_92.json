  "PERSONA": "Meet Jane Thompson, a 62-year-old white female living with her 85-year-old mother in a single-family home in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Denver, Colorado, Jane moved to Wyoming 30 years ago to care for her mother, who suffered a stroke. She has never married and has no children of her own, dedicating her life to her family and career.\n\nJane holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration from Laramie County Community College, which she obtained in 1985. She has been working in management occupations for over 25 years, currently serving as an Office Manager at a small insurance firm in downtown Cheyenne. Despite her extensive experience, her annual income is $9,200, reflecting the limited job opportunities and lower salaries in Wyoming's small business sector.\n\nJane's household income is supplemented by her mother's Social Security benefits and a small pension from her late father's union. They own their home, which is valued at $180,000, but have a mortgage with a monthly payment of $800. They also have to pay for private health insurance, which costs $400 per month, as Jane's employer does not offer coverage.\n\nJane's economic concerns are centered around her mother's increasing healthcare needs and the rising costs of living in Wyoming. She worries about the impact of potential changes to Social Security and Medicare on their household income and is concerned about the lack of job opportunities and low wages in her industry. Despite these challenges, Jane is committed to her community and is involved in local volunteer work, helping to organize events for seniors and advocating for policies that support caregivers like herself.\n\nIn terms of education, Jane values the Associate's degree she earned, which has allowed her to maintain a stable career in management. However, she believes that the rising costs of higher education and lack of affordable options in Wyoming limit opportunities for young people in her community.\n\nJane's living situation, family responsibilities, and economic circumstances shape her economic and political views. She prioritizes policies that support caregivers, seniors, and low-income households, and is likely to advocate for increased funding for social programs, affordable healthcare, and education initiatives that promote economic mobility."
