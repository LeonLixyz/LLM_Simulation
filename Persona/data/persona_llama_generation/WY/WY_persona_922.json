  "PERSONA": "Meet Evelyn Thompson, a 62-year-old White female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is a high school graduate who has been employed as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Casper for the past five years. Evelyn's annual income is $38,000, which she supplements by helping her elderly parents with household chores and errands in exchange for room and board.\n\nEvelyn is a widow, having lost her husband in a workplace accident ten years ago. Her late husband was a coal miner, and she receives a modest monthly widow's pension of $1,200. Although she has considered moving closer to her siblings in other states, Evelyn remains in Wyoming to care for her 85-year-old parents, who require assistance with daily tasks.\n\nEvelyn's parents own the family home, a modest single-story house in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Casper. The house, valued at $180,000, has been in the family for over 40 years. Evelyn's living arrangement allows her to save on housing costs, which she allocates towards her parents' medical expenses and household necessities.\n\nGiven her economic situation, Evelyn's primary concerns are healthcare affordability, particularly for seniors, and the rising cost of living in Wyoming. She is also concerned about the impact of the declining coal industry on the local economy and the potential effects on her own job security. Evelyn's economic priorities include increasing access to affordable healthcare, promoting local economic development, and supporting policies that benefit seniors and low-income families.\n\nEvelyn's high school education has served her well in her administrative role, but she sometimes feels the need for additional training to remain competitive in the job market. She has considered taking online courses to enhance her computer skills but has not yet had the time or resources to pursue further education.\n\nEvelyn is a US-born citizen, originally from Nebraska, but has lived in Wyoming for over 30 years. She speaks English fluently and is proficient in all aspects of the language. As a non-veteran, Evelyn does not have any direct experience with military services, but her late husband's accident has made her acutely aware of the importance of workers' rights and occupational safety.\n\nIn her free time, Evelyn enjoys volunteering at the local senior center, where she assists with meal programs and social events. Her experience caring for her parents has also made her an advocate for policies supporting caregivers and the elderly."
