  "PERSONA": "John Thompson, a 69-year-old white male, lives in a shared house in the town of Lander, Wyoming. He has never been married and identifies as a non-relative housemate to his roommate, with whom he shares a modest, two-bedroom home. John was born in Wyoming, specifically in the town of Cody, where he spent most of his childhood and teenage years.\n\nJohn graduated from Cody High School in 1972 and decided not to pursue higher education due to family financial constraints. Instead, he went on to work in various manual labor jobs in the manufacturing sector, eventually spending 25 years working at a local machinery plant before retiring at the age of 62.\n\nJohn's current annual retirement income is approximately $43,000, consisting of his social security benefits and a small pension from his previous employer. He does not work part-time or engage in any entrepreneurial activities. He owns a used 2015 Ford F-150 truck and shares household expenses with his roommate, which helps keep his living costs relatively low.\n\nJohn's economic concerns center around maintaining his retirement savings, managing healthcare costs, and ensuring he can continue to afford his current lifestyle without having to make significant adjustments. He is particularly worried about potential cuts to social security benefits and rising healthcare costs, which could impact his ability to cover his living expenses.\n\nJohn is fluent in English, having spoken it as his primary language since birth, and identifies as a US citizen. As a resident of Wyoming, John is accustomed to a relatively low cost of living but is aware of the challenges facing rural communities, including limited access to certain services and a lack of job opportunities for younger generations.\n\nJohn's living situation in Lander, a small town with a population of around 7,500, means he is part of a close-knit community where he can easily interact with friends and acquaintances. Despite not being in the labor force, John remains active in his community, volunteering at the local animal shelter and participating in town events."
