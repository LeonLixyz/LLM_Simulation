  "PERSONA": "Elena M. Garc\u00eda is a 79-year-old Mexican-American woman who resides in the small town of Thermopolis, Wyoming, with her 82-year-old husband, Jorge. They have been married for 55 years and have two adult children, both living out of state, with a total of five grandchildren. Elena was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, and moved to the United States with her family at the age of 25. She became a naturalized US citizen in 1980.\n\nElena is a high school graduate, having completed her diploma through a night school program for adult learners. She does not speak Spanish at home, preferring English, which she speaks well. Elena's husband, Jorge, is a retired miner who worked in the local coal mines for over three decades. Elena was a homemaker for most of her life, dedicating her time to raising their children and managing the household.\n\nThe Garc\u00edas own a modest, two-bedroom home in a quiet neighborhood near the Big Horn River. Their house, purchased in 1995, is valued at approximately $180,000. Elena's husband receives a pension from his mining days, and they also rely on Social Security benefits. Their combined annual household income is around $55,000.\n\nElena's primary concerns are related to healthcare and accessibility of medical services in their rural area. With her husband's health declining, she worries about the availability of specialized care and the financial implications of potential long-term care. Elena also keeps a close eye on local politics, particularly policies affecting senior citizens, veterans, and the mining community, which has been a significant part of their lives."
