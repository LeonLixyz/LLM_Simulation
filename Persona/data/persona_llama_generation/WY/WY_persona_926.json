  "PERSONA": "Maria Elena Ramirez, a 62-year-old Puerto Rican woman, born and raised in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming. She resides in the small town of Lander, where she has lived for over 40 years. Maria Elena is the primary householder of her household, although she is currently widowed, having lost her husband three years ago after 35 years of marriage. \n\nMaria Elena's educational background includes attending Casper College for two years, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree due to financial constraints. She is proficient in English and speaks it well, having been born and raised in the US. Maria Elena's family has a strong Puerto Rican heritage, which she takes great pride in, often celebrating traditional holidays and cooking traditional meals.\n\nAs the primary householder, Maria Elena owns her home, which she and her late husband purchased 25 years ago. The house is a modest, two-bedroom property in a quiet neighborhood with a small garden where she grows her own vegetables. Maria Elena's late husband was a coal miner, and his pension and life insurance have allowed her to maintain a relatively stable financial situation without needing to re-enter the workforce.\n\nMaria Elena's economic situation is stable, with a monthly income of $3,200 from her late husband's pension and social security benefits. She has managed to pay off her mortgage and only has to worry about utility bills, groceries, and occasional home maintenance costs. Her main economic concern is healthcare costs, as she has diabetes and requires regular medication and check-ups. Maria Elena is also concerned about the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing prices of groceries and heating bills during the harsh winters.\n\nMaria Elena spends most of her time volunteering at the local community center, where she teaches cooking classes and helps with events. She is also an active member of the Lander Historical Society, where she helps preserve the town's history and culture. Maria Elena's main priority is maintaining her independence and staying connected with her community, which is essential to her well-being and sense of purpose."
