  "PERSONA": "Harold Thompson, a 79-year-old white male, lives in a modest, single-story house with his 102-year-old mother in a quiet suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Harold has never been married and has dedicated his life to caring for his mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. As a high school graduate, Harold's education was limited, but he was skilled with his hands and worked as a mechanic for over three decades before retiring at the age of 65.\n\nDue to his age and caregiving responsibilities, Harold is not in the labor force. His income consists of his Social Security benefits ($1,800/month) and a small pension from his former employer ($500/month). Harold's mother also receives Social Security benefits ($1,200/month), which helps cover their living expenses.\n\nHarold's household income is approximately $43,200 per year. Their monthly expenses include $800 for the mortgage (which is nearly paid off), $500 for groceries, $300 for utilities, $200 for transportation (gas and maintenance for his 2007 Ford F-150), and $500 for his mother's medical expenses. They have limited savings, about $10,000 in a joint savings account, which they try to preserve for emergencies.\n\nHarold's primary economic concerns are the rising costs of healthcare and the potential for changes to Social Security benefits. He is also worried about the increasing property taxes in Cheyenne, which might force them to sell their home. Harold's economic priorities are to maintain a comfortable life for himself and his mother, ensuring they can afford basic necessities and some minor luxuries, like occasional dining out.\n\nIn terms of his community, Harold is a lifelong resident of Wyoming and has a strong sense of loyalty to the state. He values the conservative traditions and the strong sense of community in Cheyenne. Harold's political views tend to lean towards conservative, particularly on issues related to healthcare, taxation, and government spending. However, his primary focus is on ensuring the well-being of his mother and himself, and he is open to considering policies that might benefit their situation.\n\nDespite his advanced age, Harold remains relatively healthy, with only minor health issues related to arthritis. He spends most of his free time caring for his mother, gardening, and watching local news. Harold's social interactions are limited due to his caregiving responsibilities, but he occasionally attends community events and visits with a few close friends from his former workplace."
