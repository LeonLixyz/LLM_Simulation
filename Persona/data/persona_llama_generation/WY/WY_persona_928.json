  "PERSONA": "Meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 38-year-old White female residing in Casper, Wyoming. She is the primary householder of a single-person household, having recently married her partner, Ryan, in a small ceremony last year, but they are currently living apart due to Ryan's work commitments in another state.\n\nAlex was born in Billings, Montana, but has called Wyoming home for the past eight years. She is a US citizen by birth and speaks English fluently, having never spoken any other language at home. Her high school diploma from Billings Senior High School is her highest level of education, which she obtained in 2004.\n\nProfessionally, Alex works as a Sales Associate at a local outdoor gear store in Casper, earning an annual salary of $42,500. She has been employed with the company for five years and values the flexible schedule it offers, allowing her to pursue her passion for hiking and rock climbing in her free time. Alex's job involves interacting with customers, managing inventory, and participating in local outdoor events to promote the store.\n\nAlex rents a cozy one-bedroom apartment in the downtown area of Casper for $850 per month. The apartment is within walking distance to her workplace, local restaurants, and the scenic Platte River Trails. She appreciates the convenience of her living situation but hopes to save enough for a down payment on a house in the near future.\n\nAs a single female without kids, Alex's economic concerns revolve around saving for the future, managing her debt from a car loan, and ensuring she has a stable career path. She is particularly interested in local economic development initiatives that support small businesses and outdoor recreation, as these directly impact her livelihood and personal interests. Alex's political views are shaped by her desire for economic stability, access to affordable healthcare, and environmental protection, especially in the context of Wyoming's natural resources and tourism industry."
