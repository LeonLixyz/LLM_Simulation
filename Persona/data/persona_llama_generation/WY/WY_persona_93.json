  "PERSONA": "Margaret \"Maggie\" Thompson is a 62-year-old White female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is married to her husband, John, whom she met while pursuing her Associate's degree in Healthcare Administration from Casper College. Maggie is currently not in the labor force, having retired from her role as a medical office manager at a local clinic in 2018 after 20 years of service. Her husband, John, works as a mechanic at a small, family-owned auto repair shop. They have two adult children, Emily and Ryan, who have moved out but visit frequently.\n\nMaggie and John reside in a modest, single-story home in a quiet suburban neighborhood, which they purchased in 2002 for $120,000. They have a mortgage with 15 years remaining and pay approximately $800 per month. Maggie's annual income from her retirement and investments falls within the $30,000 to $34,999 range, while John's income from the auto repair shop is around $45,000 per year. They rely on public insurance coverage, primarily Medicare, for their healthcare needs.\n\nAs a homemaker, Maggie spends most of her time taking care of her 85-year-old mother, who lives with them and requires assistance with daily activities. Maggie's mother contributes $10,000 per year to the household income from her own retirement savings. Maggie's primary economic concerns revolve around ensuring her mother's care, managing their household expenses, and maintaining their standard of living on a relatively fixed income. She is also concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on their public insurance coverage.\n\nMaggie's educational background and work experience in healthcare administration have given her a strong understanding of the US healthcare system and its intricacies. Her experiences as a caregiver for her mother have also made her more aware of the challenges faced by the elderly and the importance of accessible, affordable healthcare. Maggie's views on economic and political issues are shaped by her personal experiences, and she tends to prioritize policies that support seniors, caregivers, and small businesses like her husband's auto repair shop."
