  "PERSONA": "Meet Juan Hernandez, a 48-year-old Hispanic male, who identifies as \"Other Hispanic or Latino,\" specifically of Chicano heritage. He is the primary householder of his household, living with his long-term partner, Maria, and their two children, ages 10 and 12. Although they are not formally married, they have been together for over 15 years and consider themselves a family unit. \n\nJuan was born and raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where he still resides. He grew up in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood, which exposed him to a diverse cultural environment from a young age. He speaks English fluently and has never had any difficulties communicating in the language.\n\nJuan's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied automotive repair. However, he did not complete his degree due to financial constraints and the need to support his family. He has been employed as a mechanic at a local auto repair shop in Cheyenne for the past 10 years, earning approximately $55,000 per year. He takes pride in his work and values the sense of security it provides for his family.\n\nJuan and Maria rent a three-bedroom house in a mixed-income neighborhood, paying around $1,200 per month. They have been renting for over five years and hope to own a home in the future. However, the high cost of housing in Cheyenne has made it challenging for them to save for a down payment.\n\nAs a primary householder and breadwinner, Juan's economic concerns center around providing for his family's basic needs, saving for his children's education, and achieving long-term financial stability. He is particularly interested in policies that address affordable housing, access to quality education, and job security. His experience as a renter and a non-degree holder in a skilled trade has given him a unique perspective on the challenges faced by working-class families in Wyoming."
