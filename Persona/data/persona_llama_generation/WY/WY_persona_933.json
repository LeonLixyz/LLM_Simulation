  "PERSONA": "John Thompson is a 68-year-old white male, a primary householder living in a single-family home in the small town of Cody, Wyoming. As a high school graduate, he completed his education at Cody High School in 1974. John has been divorced for over a decade and has no children from his previous marriage. Born in the United States and a lifelong resident of Wyoming, John has a deep connection to his community and the state's rural lifestyle.\n\nHaving worked as a mechanic for over 30 years, John is now retired and not part of the labor force. His retirement income comes from a combination of his Social Security benefits and a modest pension from his years of service at a local garage. John's annual retirement income is approximately $43,000, allowing him to maintain a relatively comfortable lifestyle in Cody, where he owns his home outright, having paid off the mortgage several years ago.\n\nJohn's home is a single-story, three-bedroom house on the outskirts of Cody, with a small garden where he grows his own vegetables. He spends his days tending to his garden, fishing in the nearby rivers, and occasionally helping out at the local community center with minor repairs and maintenance. John is fluent in English and speaks it well, having grown up in an English-speaking household.\n\nAs a divorced individual without children, John's primary concern is his healthcare and ensuring he can afford any medical expenses that may arise in his golden years. He is keenly interested in local and national policies affecting healthcare, particularly Medicare and the availability of medical services in rural areas. John's economic priorities include maintaining his standard of living, keeping his property taxes low, and ensuring the continuation of his retirement benefits."
