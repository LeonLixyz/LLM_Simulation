She is currently employed as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Casper, earning an annual salary of $43,500.\n\nShe rents a two-bedroom apartment in a modest neighborhood in Casper, paying $850 per month. Her economic situation is relatively stable, but she has some concerns about her financial security, particularly regarding her ability to afford healthcare and save for retirement. She is worried about potential changes to healthcare policies and their impact on her access to medical services.\n\nHer marital status as \"now married, except separated\" indicates she is currently going through a divorce, which adds to her financial stress. Despite these challenges, she values independence and is determined to maintain her economic stability. Her economic priorities include affordable healthcare, stable employment, and access to affordable housing.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, she is also concerned about the economic implications of the state's reliance on the energy industry and the potential impact of policy changes on local job markets.
