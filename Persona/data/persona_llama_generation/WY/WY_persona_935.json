  "PERSONA": "Meet 29-year-old Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a white woman with a mix of Native American ancestry, living in the heart of Cheyenne, Wyoming. As the primary householder of her single-person household, Alex resides in a modest, rented apartment in a middle-class neighborhood. She is divorced, having ended a three-year marriage two years ago. \n\nAlex is a non-veteran, born and raised in Wyoming, specifically in the town of Laramie, where she spent most of her childhood. She is a US citizen, fluent in English, and has never spoken any other language at home.\n\nAlex holds an Associate's degree in Business Administration, which she earned from Laramie County Community College. After completing her degree, she moved to Cheyenne to pursue better job opportunities. She has been employed as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company for the past four years, earning a yearly income of $43,500. Her job provides her with a stable income, health insurance, and a 401(k) plan.\n\nAs a single female without kids, Alex prioritizes financial stability and security. Her economic concerns include saving for a down payment on a house, paying off her student loan debt of $12,000, and building an emergency fund. She allocates 20% of her income towards saving and debt repayment. Alex is interested in local economic development, affordable housing, and access to quality education, as these issues directly impact her life and future plans.\n\nAlex's daily commute is relatively short, as she lives close to downtown Cheyenne. She values the outdoors and often spends her free time exploring the nearby natural attractions, such as the Cheyenne Botanic Gardens and the Vedauwoo Recreation Area. Her social life consists of close friendships with colleagues and acquaintances from her book club and hiking group."
