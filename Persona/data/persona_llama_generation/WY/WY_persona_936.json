  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 22-year-old White male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state's capital and largest city. Ethan resides with his parents in a suburban neighborhood, where he has grown up. He is a non-veteran and a U.S. citizen by birth, with English as his only language, which he speaks fluently.\n\nEthan's educational background includes completing two years at Laramie County Community College, where he studied automotive technology but did not obtain a degree. He decided to enter the workforce early to gain practical experience. Currently, Ethan is employed as an automotive technician at a local car dealership, earning approximately $38,000 per year. His job involves diagnosing and repairing issues with domestic and foreign vehicles, a role he finds challenging and rewarding.\n\nAs the youngest child, Ethan lives with his parents, John and Sarah, in a single-family home owned by his parents. The household has a combined income of around $75,000, with his father working as a high school teacher and his mother as a part-time librarian. Ethan contributes to the household income but does not pay rent, instead, helping with utility bills and other expenses.\n\nEthan's primary economic concerns revolve around saving money for his future, aiming to move out of his parents' house within the next few years. He is also interested in continuing his education to specialize in a particular area of automotive technology, such as electric vehicles, to increase his earning potential. Given his situation, Ethan is likely to support policies that promote affordable education, job training programs, and initiatives that foster economic growth in Wyoming, particularly in the automotive and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIn his free time, Ethan enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing, taking advantage of Wyoming's natural beauty. He is also an avid follower of local sports teams, especially the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo events. Ethan's social circle consists mainly of friends from high school and colleagues from work, with whom he often hangs out at local restaurants or attends community events.\n\nEthan's living situation and employment status make him keenly aware of the local economy and the challenges faced by young adults in Wyoming. His experiences and concerns are likely to influence his economic and political views, prioritizing issues that affect his generation and community directly."
