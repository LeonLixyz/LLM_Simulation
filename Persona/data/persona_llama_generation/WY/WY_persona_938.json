  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 28-year-old female, who identifies as White and Native American, born in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming. She lives with her parents in a suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, the state capital, which has a population of around 64,000 people.\n\nAlex is a high school graduate, having attended Cheyenne Central High School, where she was actively involved in the school's debate team and volunteer programs. She did not pursue higher education due to financial constraints and her parents' expectations of entering the workforce early. \n\nAs a non-veteran, Alex has no military background. She is fluent in English, having spoken it as her primary language since birth. She has never married and does not have any dependents. \n\nAlex works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local insurance agency in downtown Cheyenne, earning approximately $28,000 annually. She has been employed in this role for three years, having started immediately after high school. Her job provides her with basic health insurance and paid time off, but she does not have any retirement plan.\n\nAlex's parents own their home, a two-story house in a middle-class neighborhood, where Alex has a small room and contributes $200 per month to the household expenses. The family has a combined annual income of around $60,000, which is considered lower-middle-class in Wyoming.\n\nGiven her financial situation, Alex's primary economic concerns include saving for her own apartment, paying off her high school loans, and potentially pursuing further education or vocational training to improve her career prospects. She is interested in local politics, particularly issues related to education, affordable housing, and job creation in Wyoming."
