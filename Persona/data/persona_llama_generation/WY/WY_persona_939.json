  "PERSONA": "Agnes Thompson, an 87-year-old white female living in a single-family home in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Born in Illinois, Agnes relocated to Wyoming after retiring from the US Air Force, where she served for 20 years as a Lieutenant Colonel. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Nursing from the University of Illinois and had a successful career as a nurse practitioner before her military service. \n\nAs the primary householder, Agnes owns her modest, single-story home in a quiet suburban neighborhood, which she purchased in 2002 for $140,000. Her annual property taxes are around $1,800. Agnes has never married and has no children. She is a proud veteran and actively participates in local veterans' organizations, often volunteering at the Cheyenne VA Medical Center.\n\nAgnes's annual retirement income is approximately $43,000, consisting of her military pension ($28,000), social security benefits ($10,000), and a small annuity ($5,000) from her investments. She has a moderate level of savings, with about $250,000 in a money market account and $100,000 in a retirement account. Agnes's monthly expenses are relatively low, with $800 going towards her mortgage (which she expects to pay off in 5 years), $300 for utilities, $500 for groceries, and $200 for transportation.\n\nAgnes is concerned about potential cuts to veterans' benefits and social security, as these are crucial to her financial stability. She is also worried about rising healthcare costs and the availability of quality medical services in her area. Despite these concerns, Agnes is financially secure and feels grateful for her military service, which provided her with a comfortable retirement. She values independence, self-reliance, and community service, often reflecting on her life experiences and the importance of giving back."
