  "PERSONA": "Maria Elena Garcia is a 22-year-old Hispanic female of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States but in a different state than where she currently resides, Wyoming. She is married but not separated and lives with her husband's family, serving as another relative of the household. Maria speaks English fluently, having grown up in the US. She has attended some college but does not hold a degree. \n\nMaria works as a part-time administrative assistant at a local healthcare facility in Casper, Wyoming, earning $25,000 annually. She is a key contributor to the household income, which also includes her husband's income as a construction worker and his parents' income from their small business. The combined household income is approximately $65,000 per year.\n\nMaria and her husband are currently saving to move into their own home, as they are currently living in the in-laws' home, a modest 3-bedroom house in a mixed-income neighborhood. They have a 2-year-old son, and Maria's primary economic concerns include saving for her son's education, securing stable and well-paying employment, and eventually owning their own home. Maria's educational background in business administration has been instrumental in her current role, and she hopes to return to college to complete her degree, which she believes will enhance her career prospects and earning potential.\n\nGiven her role in a healthcare facility, Maria is keenly aware of the importance of affordable healthcare and often finds herself advocating for policies that support accessible and affordable healthcare options for working families like hers. Her experience living in a mixed-income neighborhood and her interactions with diverse patients at work have also made her sensitive to issues of income inequality and the need for economic policies that support low- and moderate-income families in achieving financial stability."
