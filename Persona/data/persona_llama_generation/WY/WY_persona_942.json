  "PERSONA": "Meet Ana Morales, a 38-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity. Born and raised in Wyoming, Ana is a US citizen who speaks English fluently, having never spoken Spanish at home. She has never been married and currently resides with her aunt in a modest, single-family home in the outskirts of Cheyenne, the state's capital city. Ana's aunt, who owns the house, is a widow and has been a significant influence in Ana's life since her parents moved back to Mexico when Ana was a teenager.\n\nAna holds an Associate's degree in Healthcare Administration from Laramie County Community College, which she obtained after completing her high school education in Cheyenne. Her educational background has been instrumental in securing her current job as a medical records clerk at a local hospital. She has been employed there for five years, earning an annual salary of $42,000.\n\nAs a non-homeowner, Ana contributes to the household expenses, including rent and utilities, which amounts to about $800 per month. Her economic situation is relatively stable, but she has concerns about saving for the future, particularly for retirement and potential homeownership. Given her income and family responsibilities, Ana prioritizes affordable healthcare, education, and job security in her political views.\n\nAna's experience growing up in a predominantly white state has made her appreciate the importance of cultural diversity and representation. She actively participates in local Latinx community events and advocates for policies that support minority groups. Despite her busy schedule, Ana volunteers at a local health clinic that serves the uninsured and underinsured population, further deepening her understanding of the healthcare system and its shortcomings.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ana is well aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy industry and its impact on the environment. She supports sustainable practices and renewable energy initiatives, recognizing the need for a balanced approach to economic growth and environmental conservation.\n\nAna's economic concerns, educational background, and community involvement shape her political views, making her a unique and informed individual within her demographic group."
