  "PERSONA": "Maria Rodriguez, a 38-year-old Hispanic woman, is a US-born citizen who lives in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with her husband, Carlos, and their two children, ages 7 and 9. Born in Wyoming to parents of Mexican descent, Maria speaks Spanish as her primary language at home but is proficient in English, which she uses at work.\n\nMaria is a high school graduate who attended a local community college for two years, studying early childhood education but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. She is currently employed as a preschool teacher's assistant at a local daycare center, earning an annual income of $32,000. Her job is stable, with benefits, but she wishes she could pursue higher education to advance her career and increase her earning potential.\n\nMaria's husband, Carlos, works as a mechanic at a local garage, earning a slightly higher income of $45,000 per year. Together, they rent a three-bedroom apartment in a working-class neighborhood in Cheyenne for $1,200 per month. They are planning to save for a down payment on a house but face challenges due to their combined income and high childcare costs.\n\nMaria's economic concerns include the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly housing and healthcare expenses, as well as access to quality education for her children. She is interested in local policies that support working families, such as affordable childcare options and job training programs. As a voter, Maria tends to prioritize issues related to education, family support services, and economic development in her community.\n\nAs a non-voter in national elections until recently, Maria has become more engaged in local politics due to her children's education and the increasing cost of living in Wyoming. She is likely to support policies that benefit working-class families and promote economic growth in her state, especially if they address specific issues affecting her community."
