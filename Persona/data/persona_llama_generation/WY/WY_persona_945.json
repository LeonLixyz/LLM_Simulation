  "PERSONA": "Austin Lee Thompson is a 22-year-old white male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Emily, whom he met in his junior year. They currently reside with Austin's older brother, who owns a modest single-family home in a suburban neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne. Austin works as a diesel mechanic at a local truck repair shop, earning approximately $42,000 per year. \n\nAustin graduated from Cheyenne Central High School in 2019 and decided to enter the workforce immediately, opting against college due to financial constraints and a strong interest in hands-on work. His job requires him to be physically active and work varying shifts, including some evenings and weekends. \n\nAustin's wife, Emily, is currently a part-time student at Laramie County Community College, studying to be a dental hygienist. She works part-time as a server at a local restaurant to help support their living expenses. They have no children but are planning to start a family within the next three years.\n\nAustin's primary economic concerns include affordable healthcare, especially with his wife's student status, and the rising cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly housing costs. He is keenly aware of the local economic situation, having seen several friends and acquaintances struggle to find stable employment. Austin and Emily are currently saving to move into their own apartment or a small starter home but face challenges due to high mortgage rates and down payment requirements."
