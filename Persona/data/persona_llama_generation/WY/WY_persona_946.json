  "PERSONA": "Reginald Thompson is a 68-year-old retired African American male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with his wife, Barbara. Born in Wyoming, Reginald is a lifelong resident of the state, having grown up in a small town near Cheyenne. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he earned in 1978. After college, Reginald worked for over three decades in the finance sector, specifically in banking, where he rose to the position of Assistant Vice President at a local bank. He retired in 2015, at the age of 60, with a comfortable pension and a modest 401(k) savings plan.\n\nReginald is now fully engaged in his retirement, enjoying hobbies such as fishing and woodworking. He and his wife own a cozy, single-story home in a quiet suburban neighborhood in Cheyenne, which they purchased in 1992 for $120,000. The house is now valued at around $280,000. Reginald's annual retirement income is approximately $55,000, comprising his pension, 401(k) withdrawals, and Social Security benefits.\n\nReginald's wife, Barbara, is 67 years old and also retired. She previously worked as a school librarian and now volunteers at a local library. They have no children together, but Reginald has a 42-year-old son from a previous marriage, who lives in Denver, Colorado, with his family. Reginald and Barbara are proud grandparents of two grandsons, aged 10 and 12.\n\nReginald's economic concerns include rising healthcare costs, particularly for prescription medications, and the impact of inflation on his fixed retirement income. He is also worried about the long-term sustainability of Social Security and the potential for future reductions in benefits. Politically, Reginald identifies as a moderate Democrat and is interested in policies that support seniors, education, and the local economy."
