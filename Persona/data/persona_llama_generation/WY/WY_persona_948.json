  "PERSONA": "Meet Emily Thompson, a 62-year-old white female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is a divorcee who has been married twice, first at the age of 25 and then again at 38, with her second marriage ending in divorce 10 years ago. Emily is a veteran of the US Army, where she served for 6 years as a nurse, achieving the rank of Captain before being honorably discharged. She speaks English fluently and was born in Billings, Montana, but has resided in Wyoming for the past 15 years.\n\nEmily holds a Master's degree in Healthcare Administration from the University of Wyoming. Her educational background and experience in the military have significantly influenced her career trajectory. She currently works as a Healthcare Consultant for a small firm in Casper, with an annual income of $85,000. Her job involves assessing the operational efficiency of healthcare facilities across Wyoming and providing recommendations for improvement.\n\nAs the spouse of the household, Emily lives with her partner, John, a 65-year-old retired school teacher, in a single-family home they own in a suburban neighborhood. They have no children together, but Emily has a 30-year-old daughter from her first marriage who lives in Denver, Colorado. Emily's household income is supplemented by John's retirement pension, totaling around $120,000 per year. They have a mortgage of $800 per month and own two vehicles, a 2018 Subaru Outback and a 2020 Ford F-150.\n\nEmily's economic concerns include the rising costs of healthcare, the impact of inflation on their retirement savings, and the need for better infrastructure in rural Wyoming. Her experience as a veteran and her work in healthcare have made her keenly aware of the importance of accessible, quality healthcare services. She is also concerned about the environment and supports policies that promote renewable energy and conservation.\n\nGiven her background, education, and career, Emily is likely to be interested in policies that address healthcare reform, veterans' benefits, and economic development in rural areas. Her experience as a small business professional also makes her attentive to policies affecting small businesses and entrepreneurship."
