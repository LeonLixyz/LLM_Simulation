  "PERSONA": "Meet Elena Garc\u00eda, a 38-year-old Mexican woman, born in the Philippines to Mexican parents who were working abroad at the time. She is married to a U.S. citizen, John, whom she met while working in the hospitality industry in Las Vegas. They moved to Casper, Wyoming, where John is from, about five years ago. Elena and John have two children, ages 6 and 8, who attend the local elementary school.\n\nElena works as a part-time administrative assistant at a small medical clinic in Casper, earning $28,000 per year. She has been in this role for three years and is valued for her bilingual skills, although she only speaks English at home and in most professional settings. Her husband, John, works as a mechanic at a local car dealership and earns around $55,000 per year. They rent a three-bedroom house in a modest neighborhood for $1,200 per month.\n\nElena has some college credits but did not complete her degree in business administration due to financial constraints. She hopes to resume her studies once her children are older. As a non-U.S. citizen, Elena is currently in the process of obtaining her green card, a process that has been ongoing for the past two years. This situation makes her keenly aware of immigration policies and their impact on families.\n\nElena's primary economic concerns are saving for her children's education, paying off debts accumulated from her husband's past medical issues, and eventually purchasing a home. She is interested in local policies that support working families, such as affordable childcare initiatives and programs that help with homeownership. Elena and her family are not struggling to make ends meet but are cautious about their financial future, especially with the rising costs of living in Wyoming."
