He resides with his parents in a single-family home in a middle-class neighborhood. Ryan is married to his wife, Emily, whom he met while working in the oil and gas industry. They do not have children.\n\nRyan's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied diesel mechanics but did not complete his degree. He began working in the oil fields shortly after dropping out of college and has been employed consistently since.

His job requires him to be away from home for weeks at a time, but it provides a stable income and benefits.\n\nRyan's economic concerns include the fluctuating oil prices affecting his job security and the rising cost of living in Casper. He and his wife are considering purchasing a home but are hesitant due to the uncertainty in the oil industry. Ryan's parents, with whom he lives, are nearing retirement, and he is concerned about their financial stability and potential need for his support in the future.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ryan is keenly aware of the state's reliance on the energy industry and the impact of federal policies on local jobs. He follows local news and is particularly interested in state and national politics related to energy, economy, and job creation. Ryan's economic priorities include job security, affordable healthcare, and access to education and training programs that support the local workforce.\n\nRyan's daily life revolves around his work, family, and outdoor hobbies. He enjoys hunting and fishing in his free time and is an avid supporter of conservation efforts in Wyoming. Despite living with his parents, Ryan values his independence and is working towards long-term financial stability to eventually move into his own home with his wife."
