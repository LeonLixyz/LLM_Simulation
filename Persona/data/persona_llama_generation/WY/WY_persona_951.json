  "PERSONA": "Ana Garc\u00eda, a 29-year-old White female, born in California but currently residing in Casper, Wyoming. She lives with her parents, who are of Mexican descent, and speaks Spanish at home. Ana is married to her high school sweetheart, Alex, who works as a mechanic, but they have been separated for the past six months due to his work relocation to another city. \n\nAna is a high school graduate and has been working as a part-time administrative assistant at a local medical office in Casper for the past three years, earning $32,000 annually. She chose not to pursue higher education immediately after high school due to financial constraints, but she's currently taking online courses to improve her skills in medical billing and coding.\n\nAna's family lives in a three-bedroom house that her parents own in a mixed-income neighborhood in Casper. They have been struggling to make ends meet, especially with the rising cost of living in the area, which has led Ana to take on a part-time job. Her parents are both employed, with her father working as a cook in a local restaurant and her mother as a part-time nurse. Ana contributes to the household income by paying for her personal expenses and occasionally helping with groceries.\n\nAna's primary economic concerns are finding a better-paying job, possibly in a different field, and saving enough to move out of her parents' house with her husband once he returns to Casper. She's also worried about the lack of affordable healthcare options in her community, which affects her family and many others in the area."
