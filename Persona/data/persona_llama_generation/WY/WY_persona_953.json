  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson is an 18-year-old high school graduate living with her parents in Cheyenne, Wyoming. As a recent graduate of Cheyenne Central High School, Alex is currently taking a gap year to decide on her future educational and career paths. Born in Denver, Colorado, Alex moved to Wyoming with her family at the age of 10, when her father, a petroleum engineer, took a job in the Wyoming oil industry.\n\nAlex's parents, both in their mid-40s, are high school sweethearts who value education and hard work. Her mother works part-time as a librarian at a local elementary school, while her father is a senior engineer at a major oil company. They own a modest, three-bedroom home in a suburban neighborhood near downtown Cheyenne, where Alex has grown up with her younger brother, who is 14.\n\nAs a child living with her parents, Alex does not have personal income, but her parents provide for her needs and encourage her to focus on her education and personal development. She spends her time volunteering at a local animal shelter, taking online courses to improve her coding skills, and working part-time as a babysitter for neighborhood families.\n\nAlex's economic concerns are largely shaped by her family's experiences and the local economy. Her father's job in the oil industry has been affected by fluctuations in global oil prices, leading to periods of uncertainty and reduced income. As a result, Alex is keenly aware of the importance of diversifying one's income streams and is considering pursuing a degree in computer science or a related field, which she believes will offer more job security and better career prospects.\n\nIn terms of politics, Alex is still developing her views, but her parents' experiences and the local economy have instilled in her a strong sense of pragmatism and a desire for stability. She is likely to prioritize policies that promote economic growth, support for small businesses, and investments in education and workforce development. As a young person, Alex is also concerned about issues like climate change, healthcare, and social justice, but her views on these topics are still evolving as she navigates her place in the world."
