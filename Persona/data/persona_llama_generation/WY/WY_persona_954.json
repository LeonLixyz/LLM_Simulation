  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 22-year-old white male who resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Ethan was born in Colorado but moved to Wyoming about three years ago. He is a divorced individual, having married his high school sweetheart at 19, but the couple decided to go their separate ways after two years of marriage due to irreconcilable differences. Ethan's current marital status is a result of his realization that he entered into marriage prematurely and is now focusing on his career and personal growth.\n\nEthan is a holder of a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he completed in three years. He is currently employed as an Environmental Consultant at a local firm, where he earns an annual salary of $45,000. His job involves conducting site assessments, developing environmental reports, and ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations. Ethan's educational background has provided him with a solid foundation in science and policy, which he applies in his daily work.\n\nAs the spouse of the household, Ethan shares a modest two-bedroom apartment in downtown Cheyenne with his partner, Rachel, who works as a nurse at the local hospital. They have a combined household income of $80,000, which allows them to enjoy a relatively comfortable lifestyle. However, Ethan is keenly aware of the rising costs of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing housing costs, and is concerned about saving for the future.\n\nEthan's economic concerns are centered around job security, healthcare costs, and the impact of environmental policies on his industry. As someone who has experienced the challenges of divorce at a young age, he is also passionate about access to affordable education and counseling services. In his free time, Ethan enjoys hiking and exploring the outdoors, which has deepened his appreciation for environmental conservation.\n\nAssumptions made based on the provided metadata include:\n\n- Ethan's partner, Rachel, is the household holder, and he is the spouse.\n- Ethan's divorce was amicable, and he maintains a positive relationship with his ex-spouse.\n- Ethan's job as an Environmental Consultant requires him to be proficient in English, which is consistent with his language proficiency level.\n- Ethan's education and career choices are influenced by his passion for environmental science and policy."
