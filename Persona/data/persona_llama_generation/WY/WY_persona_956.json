  "PERSONA": "A 79-year-old White, non-Hispanic female, living in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. She is a widow, having lost her husband five years ago. Despite her age, she remains in the labor force, working as a part-time librarian at the local library, a job she has held for the past seven years after retiring from her full-time career as a high school English teacher. Her job as a librarian allows her to maintain social connections and stay engaged with her community. \n\nShe holds a Master's degree in English Literature from the University of Wyoming, which she obtained in her mid-30s after raising her children. Her graduate education was crucial in securing her a stable teaching position. Her late husband was a retired geologist who worked for the state government, and his pension, along with her part-time income, provides her with a comfortable annual household income of $63,000.\n\nShe lives in her family home, a three-bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Lander, which she and her husband purchased in the 1980s. The mortgage is fully paid off, allowing her to live without the burden of housing costs. Her children, both in their 50s, live out of state, and she has two grandchildren. Although they do not live with her, they often visit during the summer, which she looks forward to.\n\nHer primary economic concerns include maintaining her healthcare coverage and ensuring that her pension and savings can support her living expenses as she ages. She is also concerned about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increase in property taxes, which affects her fixed income. Politically, she leans towards candidates who prioritize education, healthcare, and support for seniors, reflecting her personal experiences and concerns."
