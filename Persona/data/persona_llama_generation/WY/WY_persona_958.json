  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 38-year-old male, who identifies as White and Native American, born in Wyoming to parents of mixed heritage. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Rachel, and they have been together for over 10 years, with two children, ages 6 and 8. Ethan is a US citizen, born and raised in the small town of Lander, Wyoming, where his family has lived for generations.\n\nEthan holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained in 2008. However, due to various circumstances, including family responsibilities and a lack of job opportunities in his field, he has been out of the labor force for the past few years. His wife, Rachel, works part-time as a nurse, and her income is the primary source of support for the family.\n\nThe Thompsons live with Ethan's parents in a spacious, family-owned house on the outskirts of Lander. The arrangement is mutually beneficial, as Ethan helps his parents with household chores and caregiving, while his parents provide childcare support and financial assistance when needed. Ethan's father is a retired rancher, and the family still owns a small plot of land, which they use for recreational purposes.\n\nEthan is fluent in English and has no reported disabilities. He is not a veteran and has never been involved in any military service. Despite being out of the labor force, Ethan is actively engaged in his community, volunteering at local environmental organizations and participating in town hall meetings. His economic concerns revolve around finding stable, well-paying employment that aligns with his education and values, as well as ensuring a secure future for his family.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, Ethan is interested in policies that promote sustainable development, support local businesses, and provide opportunities for workforce re-entry and skill development. He is also concerned about access to affordable healthcare and education, as these are critical to his family's well-being. As a resident of a rural area, Ethan is keenly aware of the challenges faced by small communities and would like to see policies that address these unique needs.\n\nAssumption: Given the lack of information on income, I have assumed that the family's income is modest, relying on Rachel's part-time job and some financial support from Ethan's parents. This assumption is based on the fact that Ethan is not in the labor force, and the family is living with his parents."
