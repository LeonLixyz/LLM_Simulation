  "PERSONA": "A 68-year-old white female, born in the state of Montana but currently residing in a small town in Wyoming, specifically in the rural outskirts of Cody, where she has lived for the past decade. She has never been married and lives alone in a modest, single-story home she owns, which she purchased 15 years ago for $120,000. The house is valued at approximately $180,000 now, but it requires constant maintenance due to its age and the harsh local climate. She has some college education, having attended a community college in Montana for two years, studying business administration, but did not complete her degree due to financial constraints. \n\nHer income is $19,500 per year, primarily derived from a combination of a small pension from a previous part-time job as a librarian and Social Security benefits. She is not currently in the labor force, having retired early due to health reasons. Despite her efforts to maintain health insurance coverage, she has been unable to secure a plan that fits within her budget, making her one of the uninsured. \n\nHer lack of health insurance is a significant concern, as she suffers from chronic arthritis and occasionally requires medical attention. This economic strain, coupled with the rising costs of living and healthcare, influences her political views, making her more likely to support policies that aim to reduce healthcare costs and improve access to affordable insurance options for seniors. Her economic priorities also include preserving Social Security benefits and reducing the burden of property taxes on homeowners, especially seniors living on fixed incomes.\n\nShe is an English-speaking US citizen, born and raised in the United States, and has a strong sense of community, often participating in local town hall meetings and advocating for issues that affect seniors and the rural community. Despite her modest means, she values independence and self-sufficiency, which is reflective of her decision to live alone and manage her own affairs."
