  "PERSONA": "Meet Russell Thompson, a 62-year-old male living in the small town of Lander, Wyoming. As a child living with his aging parents, Russell has taken on a caregiver role, assisting with daily tasks and managing the household. He is of White and Native American ancestry, with his mother being of Cherokee descent. Due to his family responsibilities, Russell has never married and has focused on supporting his family.\n\nRussell was born in Montana but has lived in Wyoming for most of his life. He holds US citizenship and speaks English fluently, having completed some college education at Central Wyoming College in Riverton, Wyoming. However, he did not obtain a degree, instead choosing to enter the workforce early. \n\nAlthough Russell is currently not in the labor force, he has a background in retail management, having worked as an assistant store manager at a local hardware store for over a decade before leaving to care for his parents. His experience in retail has given him a strong understanding of the local economy and the challenges faced by small businesses.\n\nRussell's household income is approximately $45,000 per year, consisting of his parents' retirement benefits and his own modest savings. They live in a modest, single-story home that has been in the family for over 30 years, which they own outright. The home is located in a quiet neighborhood with a mix of retirees and young families.\n\nRussell's primary economic concerns revolve around ensuring his parents receive proper medical care and maintaining the household's financial stability. He is worried about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential impact of policy changes on his family's well-being. As a result, Russell tends to be cautious in his economic and political views, favoring stability and predictability over radical change."
