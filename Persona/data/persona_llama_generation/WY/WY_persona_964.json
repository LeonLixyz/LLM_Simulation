  "PERSONA": "Alyssa Little Deer, a 28-year-old Aztec woman, is the primary householder in a married-couple household without children. She resides in Lander, a small town in central Wyoming, with her husband, who works as a ranch hand. Alyssa was born in Wyoming and has lived there her entire life, which deeply influences her economic and political views. \n\nAlyssa has a high school diploma from Lander Valley High School and immediately entered the workforce. She works as a part-time administrative assistant at the local hospital, earning an annual income of $32,000. Her husband's income from ranch work is irregular but averages $40,000 annually, combining for a household income of $72,000. Alyssa and her husband rent a modest two-bedroom apartment in a quiet neighborhood for $800 per month, a significant portion of their income.\n\nAlyssa's family has strong ties to the land and the local community, with her ancestors being part of the indigenous peoples of the region. Her connection to the land and the history of her people influences her views on environmental policies and the management of public lands. Alyssa is fluent in English and has no proficiency in her ancestral language, which is a source of regret for her.\n\nAs a couple without children, Alyssa and her husband have more disposable income than they would with a family. However, they are cautious with their spending, prioritizing saving for a down payment on a home and retirement. Their economic concerns include affordable healthcare, access to quality education, and the preservation of Wyoming's natural resources. Alyssa is particularly concerned about the impact of climate change on local wildlife and the ranching industry, which directly affects her husband's livelihood.\n\nAlyssa's employment at the hospital has given her insight into the healthcare system, making her a strong advocate for affordable healthcare options for rural communities. Her work also allows her to see the impact of economic policies on the local population, further shaping her views on economic development and job creation. Alyssa is eager to learn more about policies affecting her community and is open to supporting candidates who prioritize the needs of rural Wyoming."
