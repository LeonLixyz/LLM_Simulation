  "PERSONA": "John, a 62-year-old white male, lives in a rural area of Cheyenne, Wyoming, with his elderly parents. He is divorced and does not have any dependents. John was born in Illinois but has been a Wyoming resident for over 20 years. He holds an Associate's degree in Automotive Technology from Laramie County Community College.\n\nDue to a work-related injury, John is no longer in the labor force, having worked as a mechanic at a local garage before his injury. He receives a modest disability benefit, which, combined with his parents' support, allows him to live comfortably but modestly. They reside in a family-owned home that has been paid off, thus eliminating mortgage payments. However, they do have to pay property taxes, which can be a financial strain.\n\nJohn's economic concerns revolve around healthcare costs, as his disability benefit does not fully cover his medical expenses. He also worries about his parents' well-being and the potential need for long-term care in the future. John's past experiences as a mechanic have given him a strong appreciation for self-sufficiency, influencing his views on economic policy. He supports initiatives that promote local job creation, especially in the manufacturing and repair sectors, and is skeptical of policies that may increase the cost of living for retirees and those on fixed incomes.\n\nJohn is fluent in English and has no language barriers, which has allowed him to stay engaged in his community through volunteering at the local animal shelter. His lack of involvement in the workforce, however, has limited his exposure to diverse viewpoints, potentially shaping his conservative stance on certain economic and social issues. Despite this, John values education and supports funding for vocational training programs, hoping that they will provide opportunities for the younger generation to acquire skills that can help them thrive in the local economy."
