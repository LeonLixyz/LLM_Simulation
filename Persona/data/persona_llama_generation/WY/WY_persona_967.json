  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 57-year-old white female, living with her 85-year-old mother in a single-family home in Casper, Wyoming. She is a never-married, non-veteran U.S. citizen, born in the state of Wyoming.\n\n**Education and Career:**\nAlex holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 1991. After college, she worked for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality as an environmental analyst for over 20 years. In 2015, she transitioned to a part-time role as an environmental consultant for a local non-profit organization, allowing her to balance her career with caregiving responsibilities for her aging mother.\n\n**Economic Situation:**\nAlex's annual income is $55,000, with a take-home pay of approximately $3,800 per month. Her part-time job offers health insurance, which also covers her mother. The household's total income is supplemented by her mother's Social Security benefits ($1,800 per month) and a modest pension from Alex's late father. They own their home, which is valued at $280,000, with a mortgage of $120,000.\n\n**Family and Living Situation:**\nAlex's mother, a widow since 2010, requires assistance with daily tasks due to mobility issues. Alex is her primary caregiver, managing her mother's finances, cooking, and providing transportation. The house, located in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Casper, has been in the family for over 40 years. Alex values the close proximity to local amenities, which enables her to balance her caregiving responsibilities with her part-time job.\n\n**Economic Concerns and Priorities:**\nAlex's primary economic concerns revolve around ensuring her mother's well-being and maintaining their standard of living. She worries about the rising costs of healthcare, potential changes to Social Security, and the impact of local economic fluctuations on her consulting work. Alex prioritizes affordable healthcare, stable social safety nets, and policies supporting caregivers and the elderly. She is also interested in environmental conservation efforts, reflecting her educational background and professional experience.\n\n**Geographic Location:**\nCasper, Wyoming, a city with a population of approximately 55,000, offers Alex a comfortable and familiar environment. The local economy is driven by industries like energy, healthcare, and education, which provides a relatively stable job market. However, Alex is aware of the challenges faced by rural communities, including limited access to specialized healthcare services and a relatively high cost of living."
