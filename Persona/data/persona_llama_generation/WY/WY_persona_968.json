  "PERSONA": "Ryan Thompson, a 38-year-old male, is a spouse of the household and has never been married, indicating he is in a long-term partnership. He identifies as White and Asian, reflecting a multicultural background that has likely influenced his worldview. Ryan was born in Oregon but currently resides in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the state capital, which suggests he may have moved for educational or career opportunities.\n\nRyan holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which he obtained after moving to the state. His educational background has been instrumental in securing his current job as an Environmental Consultant at a private firm specializing in sustainable practices. This role not only utilizes his degree but also aligns with his personal values of environmental conservation, a common concern in Wyoming due to its natural beauty and the economic importance of tourism and natural resource extraction.\n\nRyan's job provides him with a stable income of $62,000 annually, which is above the state median. This financial stability, combined with his partner's income (his partner works as a teacher at a local school), allows them to rent a modest two-bedroom house in the historic downtown area of Cheyenne. Their combined income and stable employment status make them a part of the middle class in Wyoming, with economic concerns that likely revolve around maintaining their standard of living, saving for the future, and possibly homeownership in the near future.\n\nRyan and his partner do not have children, which gives them a degree of financial flexibility and freedom to pursue hobbies and interests, such as hiking and exploring the natural beauty of Wyoming. Ryan's language proficiency in English only is reflective of his birth and upbringing in the US, and his lack of veteran status indicates he has not served in the military, which could influence his political views on defense and foreign policy.\n\nGiven his background in environmental science and his current role, Ryan is likely to be politically engaged on issues related to the environment, energy policy, and public lands management, which are particularly relevant in Wyoming. His economic situation and educational background suggest he values sustainability and responsible resource use, which could influence his voting decisions and political affiliations."
