  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson is a 22-year-old white female living with her parents in Casper, Wyoming. She was born in Denver, Colorado, but moved to Wyoming with her family at the age of 10. Emily graduated from Natrona County High School in Casper, where she was an average student but excelled in extracurricular activities such as volleyball and volunteer work. \n\nAfter high school, Emily decided to enter the workforce directly, choosing not to pursue higher education due to the financial burden it would place on her family. She is currently employed as a part-time server at a local diner in downtown Casper, earning $12.50 an hour and working approximately 25 hours a week. Her annual income is around $32,500. Emily's parents, both in their late 40s, are supportive of her decision and help her manage her finances, ensuring she saves a portion of her income each month.\n\nEmily's family lives in a modest, three-bedroom house in a middle-class neighborhood. Her father works as a mechanic at a local garage, and her mother is a part-time nurse at the Casper hospital. Emily's younger brother, 16, is a high school student. As the eldest child, Emily contributes to household expenses by paying a small rent of $200 per month and helping with household chores.\n\nEmily's economic concerns are centered around saving enough to move out of her parents' house and start her own life. She hopes to find a better-paying job or pursue vocational training that could increase her earning potential. Her political views are shaped by her family's moderate conservative stance, but she is also influenced by her friends' liberal views on social issues. Emily's main economic priorities include affordable housing, job security, and access to vocational training programs."
