  "PERSONA": "Margaret \"Peg\" Thompson, a 68-year-old retired woman living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with her husband, John. Born in Boise, Idaho, Peg moved to Wyoming 40 years ago after marrying John, who worked as a civil engineer for the state. She holds an Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education from Laramie County Community College, which she obtained in 1978. Before retirement, Peg worked part-time as a preschool teacher for 25 years, contributing to the family income while raising their two children, now grown and moved out.\n\nPeg and John own a modest, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, purchased in 1985 for $120,000. Their current home value is approximately $280,000, with a mortgage paid off in 2010. They have a combined annual income of $42,000 from John's pension, social security benefits, and Peg's part-time retirement income as a substitute teacher.\n\nTheir household expenses include $2,500 monthly for utilities, groceries, and property taxes. They allocate $1,000 monthly for healthcare, including private health insurance premiums, Medicare, and out-of-pocket medical expenses. Peg is concerned about the rising costs of healthcare, prescription medication, and potential long-term care needs, influencing her views on healthcare policy and social security.\n\nAs a retiree, Peg is not actively engaged in the workforce but remains an active member of her community. She volunteers at a local food bank and participates in advocacy groups focused on education and seniors' rights. Peg's economic priorities include preserving social security, reducing healthcare costs, and supporting local businesses.\n\nPeg's educational background and career as a preschool teacher have instilled in her a strong appreciation for the importance of early childhood education and accessible healthcare. Her experiences as a wife, mother, and community member have shaped her views on family values, economic security, and the need for policies that support working families and seniors."
