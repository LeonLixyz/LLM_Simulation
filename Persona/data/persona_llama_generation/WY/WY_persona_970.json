  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 39-year-old white male living with his parents in a suburban neighborhood in Casper, Wyoming. Ethan is a U.S. citizen, born in Idaho but raised in Wyoming. His parents, both in their early sixties, are high school sweethearts who have lived in Casper their entire lives. Ethan's father works as a mechanic at a local garage, and his mother is a part-time librarian at the county library.\n\nEthan holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wyoming, which he completed in 2007. However, after a series of unfulfilling jobs in sales and marketing, Ethan decided to take a break from the workforce. He has been out of the labor force for about three years, focusing on personal projects and helping his parents with household chores.\n\nEthan's marital status is divorced; he was married to his high school sweetheart, Rachel, for about five years before they amicably parted ways in 2015. The divorce was largely due to irreconcilable differences, and they have remained friends. Ethan does not have any children from the marriage.\n\nEthan's living situation is comfortable, with his parents owning a modest three-bedroom house in a quiet suburban neighborhood. He contributes to household expenses by helping with maintenance and repair tasks, leveraging his DIY skills to keep costs low. Ethan's parents have been supportive of his decision to take a break from work, but they encourage him to find a stable job to secure his financial future.\n\nEthan's economic concerns center around finding a fulfilling career path that utilizes his skills and education. He is worried about the rising cost of living in Wyoming, particularly the increasing housing costs and healthcare expenses. Ethan is also concerned about the state's economic diversification, as he believes the economy is too reliant on the energy sector. He hopes that the state will invest more in renewable energy and education to attract new industries and create better job opportunities.\n\nIn his free time, Ethan enjoys hiking and exploring Wyoming's natural beauty. He is an avid reader, particularly interested in history and economics. Ethan is fluent in English and has a strong proficiency in written and verbal communication. Despite not being in the labor force, Ethan remains engaged with his community, volunteering at local events and participating in online forums discussing Wyoming's economic development."
