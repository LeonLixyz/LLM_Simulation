  "PERSONA": "John \"JD\" Davenport, a 38-year-old white male, born in the state of Montana but currently residing in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the primary householder in a married-couple household without kids, but currently separated from his spouse, Rachel, due to work-related relocation differences. John is a US citizen, speaks English fluently, and holds an Associate's degree in Renewable Energy Technology from Laramie County Community College.\n\nJohn works as a Solar Panel Installation Supervisor for a local company, Cheyenne Solar Solutions, earning an annual income of $63,500. His job involves overseeing the installation of solar panels on residential and commercial properties across Wyoming, which sometimes requires him to travel to different parts of the state. He has been in this position for about 5 years and has seen the renewable energy sector grow significantly in the region.\n\nJohn and Rachel own a modest two-bedroom house in the historic downtown area of Cheyenne, which they purchased in 2018 for $270,000. They have been separated for the past year, with Rachel staying in their hometown in Montana to care for her ailing mother, while John continues to work in Wyoming. The separation has put a strain on their finances, as they maintain two households and navigate the complexities of a long-distance relationship.\n\nJohn's educational background has significantly impacted his career trajectory. After completing his Associate's degree, he started working in the construction industry and eventually transitioned to the renewable energy sector, which has been growing rapidly in Wyoming. His experience and degree have allowed him to secure a well-paying job and advance to a supervisory position.\n\nJohn's economic concerns are centered around the stability of the renewable energy industry, which is heavily influenced by government policies and regulations. He is worried about the impact of potential policy changes on his job security and the overall growth of the sector. He is also concerned about the increasing cost of living in Cheyenne, particularly the rising housing costs, which may affect his ability to maintain his current lifestyle.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, John is interested in local and national politics, particularly policies related to energy, the environment, and economic development. He is likely to support candidates and policies that promote the growth of the renewable energy sector and address the challenges faced by workers in the industry."
