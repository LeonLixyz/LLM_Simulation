  "PERSONA": "Agnes Whitehorse, a 79-year-old American Indian woman of the Shoshone tribe, living in Riverton, Wyoming. She resides in the same household as her 57-year-old son, Raymond, who works as a wildlife biologist for the state. Agnes is married to her 82-year-old husband, Henry, who is retired from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. They were married in 1964 and have been inseparable since.\n\nAgnes was born in Sheridan, Wyoming, and moved to Riverton after marrying Henry, who is from the local Wind River Reservation. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Elementary Education from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 1963. Agnes worked as a teacher at the local elementary school for over 20 years before retiring in 1995.\n\nAs a retiree, Agnes is not in the labor force and focuses on her family and community. She is fluent in English and has a strong connection to her Shoshone heritage, often participating in local cultural events and volunteering at the Wind River Reservation's senior center.\n\nAgnes and Henry own a modest, single-story home on the outskirts of Riverton, which they purchased in 1975. The house is valued at around $220,000, and they have no mortgage. Their household income is primarily composed of Henry's retirement pension and Agnes's teacher retirement benefits, totaling around $55,000 per year.\n\nGiven her age and health, Agnes's primary economic concerns are affordable healthcare and maintaining her independence. She is worried about potential changes to Medicare and Social Security, which she relies on for her well-being. Agnes is also concerned about the impact of local economic development on the Wind River Reservation and the preservation of Native American cultural heritage.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of Wyoming, Agnes is deeply connected to her community and the state's natural beauty. She values the conservative principles of self-reliance and limited government intervention, which are prevalent in Wyoming. However, her experience as a Native American and a retiree has also made her more aware of the need for social safety nets and government support for vulnerable populations."
