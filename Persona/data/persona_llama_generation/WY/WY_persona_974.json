  "PERSONA": "Ryan Thompson, a 49-year-old White male, is the primary householder of a married-couple household without kids, residing in the rural town of Cody, Wyoming. Despite being listed as \"Never married\" in official records due to a clerical error, Ryan has been in a long-term, committed relationship with his partner, Alex, for over 10 years. They chose not to formally marry due to personal preference.\n\nRyan was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and has lived in the state his entire life. He speaks English fluently, having only spoken English at home and in school. Ryan attended Cody High School but dropped out during his junior year (11th grade) to work and support his family after his father's passing. He regrets not completing his high school diploma but has since learned various skills through vocational training and on-the-job experience.\n\nRyan works as a full-time diesel mechanic at a local truck repair shop, earning $55,000 per year. He and Alex own a modest, single-family home in Cody, valued at $280,000, with a mortgage of $180,000. They have one vehicle, a 2018 Ford F-150, and enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing in their free time.\n\nRyan's economic concerns revolve around the stability of his job, as the trucking industry is subject to fluctuations in fuel prices and regulations. He also worries about the rising cost of living in Cody, particularly housing prices, which he fears may outpace his income growth. As a result, Ryan prioritizes saving for retirement and maintaining a secure financial foundation for himself and Alex."
