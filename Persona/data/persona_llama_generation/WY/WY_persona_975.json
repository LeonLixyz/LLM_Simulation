  "PERSONA": "Emily Wilson is a 79-year-old woman who resides in the small town of Cody, Wyoming. She identifies as multiracial, with both White and Black or African American heritage. Emily is married to her second husband, Jack, a retired rancher. The couple has been together for over 20 years and currently lives in a modest, two-bedroom house on the outskirts of Cody. Emily has two adult children from her previous marriage, both of whom have moved out of state for work. She has three grandchildren and one great-grandchild, whom she rarely gets to see due to the distance.\n\nEmily was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but moved to Wyoming with her first husband in the 1970s. She has a strong affinity for the American West and feels deeply connected to the land and community. Emily attended Casper College for two years but did not complete her degree due to family obligations. She has always been interested in art and has continued to take local painting classes throughout her life.\n\nEmily's primary focus is on her family and community. She volunteers at the local animal shelter and participates in community events, such as the annual Cody Stampede. Emily is not currently in the labor force, having stopped working as a part-time librarian over a decade ago. Her husband's pension and social security benefits provide a comfortable income for the couple, allowing them to maintain their home and support their family.\n\nEmily's economic concerns include the rising cost of healthcare, as she and her husband rely on Medicare and supplemental insurance to cover their medical expenses. She is also worried about the impact of climate change on local wildlife and the agricultural industry, which is a significant part of Wyoming's economy. Emily values education and is concerned about the funding of local schools, as she believes that quality education is essential for the community's future.\n\nIn terms of politics, Emily is a moderate Democrat, although she has voted for Republican candidates in the past. She prioritizes issues related to healthcare, education, and the environment. Emily is an English-speaking US citizen, born in a different state but having lived in Wyoming for most of her adult life."
