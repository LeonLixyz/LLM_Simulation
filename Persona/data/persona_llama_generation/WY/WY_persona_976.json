  "PERSONA": "Alex Thompson is a 38-year-old White male who resides in Casper, Wyoming, with his partner, whom he has been in a long-term, unmarried relationship with for over 8 years. They share a two-bedroom rental home in a modest neighborhood near downtown Casper, with a monthly rent of $850.\n\nAlex attended the University of Wyoming but did not complete his degree in Environmental Science due to financial constraints. However, he leveraged his coursework and passion for the outdoors to secure a job as a Conservation Technician with the Wyoming State Parks system, where he has been employed for the past 6 years. His annual income is $45,000, which, combined with his partner's income as a part-time teacher, provides a relatively stable financial foundation for their household.\n\nAs a non-degree holder with some college education, Alex feels he has somewhat limited career advancement opportunities, but he values the stability and sense of fulfillment his job provides. His economic concerns center around paying off his outstanding student loans ($12,000) and saving for a potential down payment on a home in the future. Given the relatively low cost of living in Casper and their combined income, they are able to enjoy some discretionary spending, particularly on outdoor activities such as hiking and camping.\n\nDespite never being married, Alex and his partner consider themselves a committed family unit and have discussed starting a family in the next few years. This has prompted them to begin exploring options for health insurance and family planning resources available in their area. Alex's partner has a 6-year-old son from a previous relationship who lives with them part-time, and Alex has taken on a significant caregiving role.\n\nAlex's economic priorities include affordable healthcare, education, and environmental conservation. He is particularly concerned about the impact of policy decisions on the local economy and the natural beauty of Wyoming, which he believes are deeply intertwined. As a resident of a state with a strong tradition of individualism and limited government intervention, Alex's political views are shaped by a desire for balance between personal freedom and the need for certain government services and protections, especially in the areas of healthcare and education."
