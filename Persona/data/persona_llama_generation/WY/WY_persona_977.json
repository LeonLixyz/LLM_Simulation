  "PERSONA": "Tyler Thompson, a 29-year-old White male living in Casper, Wyoming. He shares an apartment with his partner, Alex, in a modest two-bedroom rental in the downtown area, where they pay $850 per month. Tyler works as a sales representative for a local outdoor gear store, earning approximately $42,000 annually. He has some college education, having attended Casper College for two years before dropping out to enter the workforce due to financial constraints.\n\nTyler was born in Colorado but moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age. He identifies as a Wyoming native and has a strong connection to the state's outdoor culture. As an avid hiker and fisherman, Tyler appreciates the access to nature that Wyoming provides. He and Alex enjoy exploring the surrounding wilderness areas on weekends.\n\nTyler's family consists of his partner, Alex, and their two cats. Although they are not married, they have been in a committed relationship for five years. Tyler's parents live in a nearby town, and he visits them regularly. His father is a retired mechanic, and his mother works part-time as a librarian.\n\nTyler's economic concerns center around affording a down payment on a house, as he and Alex aspire to become homeowners in the next few years. He is also worried about the impact of Wyoming's economic fluctuations, particularly in the energy sector, on his job security. As a result, Tyler prioritizes saving and investing in a diversified portfolio to mitigate potential financial risks.\n\nIn terms of politics, Tyler tends to lean moderate, valuing individual freedoms and environmental conservation. He is concerned about the accessibility of public lands and the impact of climate change on Wyoming's natural resources. Tyler's economic situation and connection to the outdoors inform his views on policy issues, such as affordable housing, job creation, and environmental protection."
