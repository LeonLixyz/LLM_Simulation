  "PERSONA": "Margaret 'Peg' Thompson, a 68-year-old White female living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as the spouse of the household. Born in the United States, specifically in Wyoming, Peg has been a lifelong resident of the state. She is a high school graduate, having attended Cheyenne's East High School, and speaks English fluently.\n\nPeg has been divorced for over a decade and currently resides with her partner, a 72-year-old retired rancher, in a modest, single-story home on the outskirts of Cheyenne. They own their home, which they've lived in for over 20 years, and have a small mortgage. Peg's partner is the primary breadwinner of the household, with a pension from his years working as a rancher.\n\nAlthough Peg is not in the labor force, she was previously employed as an administrative assistant for a local insurance company for over 20 years before retiring at the age of 62. Her annual retirement income is approximately $25,000, which, combined with her partner's pension, gives them a household income of around $60,000 per year.\n\nPeg's primary concerns are healthcare and social security, as she and her partner rely heavily on these services in their retirement. She is particularly interested in policies that support seniors, such as affordable healthcare and protection of social security benefits. Given her rural upbringing and long-term residency in Wyoming, Peg also values policies that support local agriculture and small businesses.\n\nIn her free time, Peg enjoys gardening, volunteering at the local animal shelter, and spending time with her two adult children, who live in nearby towns with their families."
