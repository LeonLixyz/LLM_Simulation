  "PERSONA": "Ana Hern\u00e1ndez is a 38-year-old Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, born in the United States, specifically in Wyoming, where she currently resides. She lives with her parents in a single-family home in a suburban area of Cheyenne, the state capital, due to financial constraints and a desire to support her family. Ana is married but currently separated from her husband, with whom she has two children, aged 8 and 10. \n\nAna's educational background includes two years of college, where she studied business administration before dropping out due to financial difficulties. Despite not having a degree, she has managed to secure a stable job as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Cheyenne, earning approximately $43,000 annually. She works a standard 40-hour week and has access to employer-sponsored health insurance, which also covers her children.\n\nAna's family situation significantly influences her economic concerns, with childcare costs being a considerable expense. Her parents, though not financially dependent on her, benefit from her contribution to household expenses. Ana's primary economic priorities include saving for her children's education, managing the household budget effectively, and planning for her own future, possibly by pursuing further education or career advancement opportunities.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ana is aware of the state's economic reliance on the energy sector and is concerned about the impact of economic downturns on her job security and local community. She values policies that support education, affordable healthcare, and job security, especially for families. Ana's economic situation and family responsibilities shape her political views, focusing on practical, immediate issues rather than broader ideological debates."
