  "PERSONA": "Ethan Thompson, a 29-year-old White male, born in the United States, specifically in the state of Wyoming, where he currently resides. He is the primary householder in a married-couple household without kids, although his marital status is listed as never married, suggesting a long-term, unmarried partnership. Ethan is a non-veteran and speaks English fluently.\n\nEthan graduated from high school in Wyoming and did not pursue higher education, instead opting for vocational training in the electrical trade. He works as a journeyman electrician for a local contractor, earning approximately $55,000 per year. His job requires him to travel within the state for work, which he enjoys as it allows him to explore different parts of Wyoming.\n\nEthan and his partner, Sarah, live in a modest, two-bedroom house in the suburbs of Casper, Wyoming's second-largest city. They own their home, which they purchased five years ago for $170,000. Their mortgage payments, combined with other living expenses, account for about 30% of Ethan's income.\n\nGiven his economic situation, Ethan's primary concerns are affordable healthcare, access to quality education, and job security. He is particularly interested in policies that support local businesses and infrastructure development in Wyoming, as these directly impact his livelihood. As a homeowner, Ethan is also concerned about property taxes and their potential impact on his mortgage payments.\n\nEthan's lack of higher education has not hindered his career advancement, but he recognizes the value of further education in a rapidly changing job market. He occasionally attends workshops and seminars to stay updated on the latest electrical codes and technologies. Despite not having kids, Ethan and Sarah are involved in their community, volunteering at local events and supporting initiatives that promote vocational training for young people.\n\nEthan's views on politics are moderate, leaning slightly conservative due to his upbringing in a traditionally conservative state. However, his experiences as a working-class individual have made him more sympathetic to progressive policies aimed at economic equality and access to affordable healthcare."
