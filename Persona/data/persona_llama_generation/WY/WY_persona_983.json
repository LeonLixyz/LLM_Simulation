  "PERSONA": "Meet Emily Wilson, a 29-year-old white female, married to her high school sweetheart, Ryan. They reside in a cozy, two-bedroom apartment in Casper, Wyoming, which they rent for $850 per month. Emily was born in Billings, Montana, but moved to Wyoming about five years ago when Ryan secured a job as a mechanic at a local dealership.\n\nEmily's educational background includes two years of community college, where she studied business administration. Although she didn't complete her degree, she gained valuable skills that have helped her in her current role as a part-time administrative assistant at a small insurance agency in downtown Casper. She works 30 hours a week, earning $18.50 per hour, which translates to approximately $28,000 per year.\n\nAs the spouse of the household's primary breadwinner, Emily's income is supplementary to Ryan's $50,000 annual salary. Together, they have a combined household income of around $78,000. They are proud of their financial stability and are working towards saving for a down payment on a house. They currently have about $15,000 in savings, which they hope to double within the next two years.\n\nEmily and Ryan enjoy the outdoors and often spend their free time hiking and exploring Wyoming's natural beauty. They are also avid supporters of local businesses and try to shop and dine within their community as much as possible.\n\nIn terms of economic concerns, Emily is particularly worried about the rising cost of living in Casper, especially when it comes to housing. She and Ryan are eager to become homeowners but are struggling to find an affordable option. They are also concerned about the impact of Wyoming's economy on their job security, as the state's reliance on the energy industry can make the job market unpredictable.\n\nPolitically, Emily tends to lean towards moderate policies that support small businesses and promote economic growth while also addressing environmental concerns. She is passionate about education and believes that affordable access to higher education is crucial for Wyoming's future workforce. Emily is also an advocate for women's rights and reproductive healthcare, often participating in local fundraisers and awareness campaigns.\n\nAs a young, married woman with a stable but modest income, Emily's economic and political views are shaped by her desire for financial security, access to affordable education, and a healthy environment for her community to thrive."
