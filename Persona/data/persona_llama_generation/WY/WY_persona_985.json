  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson, a 27-year-old White female living in Casper, Wyoming. She is a divorced child living with her parents in a single-family home in a suburban neighborhood. Alex holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which she completed in 2020. She is a US-born citizen, born in Wyoming, and speaks English fluently. \n\nAlex is currently employed as an Environmental Consultant at a local firm, earning an annual salary of $53,000. Her job involves assessing the environmental impact of construction projects and collaborating with government agencies to ensure compliance with regulations. She has been in this role for about two years, having previously interned at the same company during her graduate studies.\n\nDespite her professional success, Alex's personal life has experienced some setbacks. She was married briefly from 2019 to 2021, but the marriage ended in divorce due to irreconcilable differences. This life event led her to move back in with her parents temporarily, as she rebuilds her financial stability and navigates her career.\n\nAlex's living situation is comfortable, with her parents owning their home outright. The household has a combined income of around $80,000, primarily from her father's work as a retired state employee and her mother's part-time job as an accountant. Alex contributes to the household expenses, paying $500 per month for rent and utilities.\n\nAlex's economic concerns are centered around saving for her own home, paying off her student loans (approximately $30,000), and building a stable financial future. Her experience with divorce has also made her more cautious about financial planning and more interested in policies that support economic security for individuals, particularly women, in similar situations. Given her background in environmental science, Alex also prioritizes policies addressing climate change and sustainable development."
