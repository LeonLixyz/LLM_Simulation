  "PERSONA": "John 'Grey Wolf' Thompson is a 68-year-old American Indian and Alaska Native male, specifically of the Shoshone tribe, living in Lander, Wyoming. He is married to his wife, Barbara, a 66-year-old retired librarian, whom he met at a cultural event celebrating Native American heritage in the region. They have been married for 40 years and have two children, both grown and living independently in other parts of the state.\n\nJohn was born in Arizona but moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age. He holds an Associate's degree in Environmental Conservation from Casper College, which he obtained in 1978. Before retiring, John worked as a park ranger at Yellowstone National Park for over two decades, which not only allowed him to utilize his educational background but also connect with his Native American roots by preserving the natural and cultural heritage of the area.\n\nJohn and Barbara own a modest, single-family home in a quiet neighborhood near the Popo Agie River in Lander. Their home, valued at approximately $220,000, is fully paid off, a source of pride and financial security for the couple. Their annual household income, primarily from John's retirement pension and Barbara's social security benefits, totals around $55,000.\n\nJohn is fluent in English and has a deep appreciation for his tribe's language, Shoshone, which he learned from his grandparents. He is not a veteran but has a strong respect for those who serve, often participating in local veteran support events.\n\nGiven his background in environmental conservation and his Native American heritage, John is deeply concerned about the environmental impact of economic policies, particularly those affecting the natural resources and wildlife of Wyoming. He is also keenly interested in policies that support education and cultural preservation for Native American communities. John's economic priorities include maintaining a stable retirement income, ensuring affordable healthcare for seniors, and promoting sustainable local economic development that respects the state's natural beauty.\n\nIn his free time, John enjoys woodworking, creating traditional Shoshone crafts, and participating in local community events that celebrate Native American culture. His economic and political views are shaped by his commitment to preserving the environment, respecting his cultural heritage, and ensuring the well-being of his community."
