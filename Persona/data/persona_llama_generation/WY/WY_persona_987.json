  "PERSONA": "Meet Ethan Thompson, a 49-year-old White male living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is the spouse of a household holder, and although the metadata indicates \"Never married,\" a reasonable assumption is that he is in a long-term, unmarried partnership. Ethan is a US citizen, born in Colorado, but has resided in Wyoming for over a decade.\n\nEthan holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of Wyoming, which has significantly influenced his career trajectory. He works as an Environmental Consultant for a small, local firm specializing in sustainable development projects. His annual income is around $65,000, which is above the state median but reflects his education and specialized skill set.\n\nEthan and his partner, Rachel, reside in a modest, two-bedroom condominium in downtown Cheyenne. They rent their home for $1,200 per month, which is relatively affordable given the area's housing market. Ethan's economic concerns include rising healthcare costs and the potential impact of climate change on local industries. He is particularly invested in environmental policies that support sustainable practices and job creation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nEthan's family structure consists of himself, his partner Rachel, and their two children from Rachel's previous marriage, whom they co-parent. The children are 10 and 12 years old, and Ethan is actively involved in their education and extracurricular activities. This blended family setup has taught him the importance of flexible work arrangements and family-friendly policies.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ethan is aware of the state's economic reliance on the fossil fuel industry. However, his work in environmental consulting has shown him the potential for diversification and growth in the renewable energy sector. This experience shapes his views on economic development, job creation, and the need for a balanced approach to environmental policy.\n\nEthan's educational background and career path have instilled in him a strong appreciation for data-driven decision-making and evidence-based policy. He values education and is committed to ensuring that the next generation has access to quality educational resources. His economic priorities include affordable healthcare, job security, and policies that support sustainable development in Wyoming."
