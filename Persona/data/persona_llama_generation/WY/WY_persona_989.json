  "PERSONA": "Meet 29-year-old Ryan Thompson, a married male living in a household with his parents in Casper, Wyoming. Ryan is a White, non-Hispanic, US-born citizen who speaks English fluently. Born in Colorado, he moved to Wyoming with his family at a young age. Ryan's educational background is limited, having completed the 8th grade before deciding to enter the workforce to support his family financially. \n\nRyan works full-time as a maintenance technician at a local oil rig, earning approximately $42,000 per year. This income, combined with his parents' earnings, contributes to the household's overall stability. Ryan and his wife, whom he married two years ago, are currently saving for their own place, but due to the high cost of housing in Casper, they have decided to live with his parents temporarily. \n\nAs a married individual with no children, Ryan's immediate economic concerns include affording a home, paying off his truck loan, and contributing to the household expenses. His limited education and relatively low income make him cautious about financial decisions, but his stable employment and supportive family environment provide him with a sense of security. Ryan's priorities include finding affordable housing, managing debt, and eventually starting a family."
