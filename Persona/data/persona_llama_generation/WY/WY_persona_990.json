  "PERSONA": "Alexandra \"Alex\" Thompson is a 62-year-old White female, born in California, but currently residing in the small town of Cody, Wyoming. She is a divorced, non-veteran, and a U.S. citizen by birth. Alex has been married twice, first in her early twenties, which ended in divorce after five years, and then again in her late thirties, which also ended in divorce about ten years ago. She has no children from either marriage. \n\nShe lives with her second ex-husband, James, in a non-traditional arrangement, where they share the household expenses and maintain separate bedrooms, yet jointly own their home. They chose this setup due to the economic benefits of shared living expenses and the companionship. They have been in this arrangement for about five years, allowing them to split the mortgage payments on their $180,000 home.\n\nAlex speaks fluent English and has a conversational understanding of Swedish, which she learned from her grandparents. Her highest level of education is two years of college, where she studied business administration but did not complete her degree. Despite this, she secured a job as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Cody. Her annual income is $42,000, which, combined with James' income as a semi-retired carpenter ($30,000 per year), provides them with a relatively comfortable lifestyle.\n\nAlex and James have some investments in stocks and bonds, totaling around $200,000, which they hope to use for retirement and travel. They also have a small pension fund from James' previous job as a carpenter, which contributes an additional $10,000 per year to their household income.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Alex is concerned about the state's reliance on the energy industry and its impact on the environment. She is also worried about the rising cost of living in Cody, particularly the increasing housing prices, which she believes may force them to reconsider their living arrangement in the future.\n\nAlex's economic priorities include maintaining her current standard of living, ensuring they have enough savings for retirement, and navigating the complexities of the healthcare system as they age. Politically, she leans towards moderate conservatism, valuing fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention in personal matters, but also believes in social safety nets and environmental protection."
