  "PERSONA": "Harold Jenkins, an 87-year-old retired male, living in a shared house with non-relatives in a rural area of Cheyenne, Wyoming. He is married but currently separated from his wife, who resides in a nearby assisted living facility due to health reasons. Harold holds a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from the University of Wyoming College of Law, which he obtained in 1963. Born in Billings, Montana, he is a U.S. citizen by birth and has lived in Wyoming for most of his adult life.\n\nHarold's economic situation is relatively stable, with a monthly income of $3,500 from his retirement pension and Social Security benefits. He owns the house he lives in, which he purchased in 1975 for $43,000, and it is now valued at approximately $280,000. His wife's care at the assisted living facility is a significant expense, costing around $4,000 per month, which they cover through a combination of her savings, Harold's pension, and some government assistance.\n\nHarold's career as a lawyer spanned over three decades, during which he worked primarily in private practice, focusing on estate and property law. He retired in 2001 at the age of 65. His educational background and professional experience have instilled in him a strong appreciation for the rule of law and a conservative approach to economic policies.\n\nAs a non-relative housemate, Harold shares his house with two younger individuals who help with household chores and maintenance in exchange for reduced rent. This arrangement allows him to maintain his independence while also providing companionship and some financial relief.\n\nGiven his age and health, Harold's primary economic concerns revolve around ensuring his wife receives the best possible care and managing his finances to cover the costs associated with her care and his own living expenses. He is keenly interested in policies affecting healthcare, particularly those related to elderly care and the affordability of assisted living facilities. Harold also closely follows discussions on Social Security and pension reforms, as these directly impact his financial security."
