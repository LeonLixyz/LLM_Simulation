  "PERSONA": "Maria Elena Garcia, a 38-year-old US-born Hispanic woman of Mexican ethnicity, resides in a household in Casper, Wyoming, as the live-in sister of the household's owner. Maria is divorced and has been out of the labor force for the past three years, primarily due to her role as a full-time caregiver for her sister's two children, ages 8 and 10, while her sister works as a nurse. \n\nMaria's educational background includes a high school diploma from Natrona County High School, where she graduated in 2003. After high school, Maria did not pursue higher education, opting instead to work in various administrative roles. Before taking on her caregiving responsibilities, Maria worked as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company in Casper.\n\nAs a non-working individual, Maria's primary source of financial support is her sister's income. Her sister's salary as a nurse is around $65,000 per year, which is sufficient to cover the household's expenses. Maria's personal income is limited to occasional freelance work, such as pet-sitting or helping friends with errands, which earns her approximately $200 to $500 per month.\n\nMaria's economic concerns primarily revolve around the financial stability of her sister's household, as she is heavily dependent on it. She is also worried about the increasing costs of living in Casper and the potential impact on her sister's job security due to the volatile nature of Wyoming's economy, heavily reliant on the energy sector. Maria's experience as a caregiver and her observations of her sister's profession have also made her acutely aware of the need for accessible and affordable healthcare, which influences her political views on healthcare policy.\n\nThe household owns a modest, single-family home in a suburban neighborhood, with a mortgage of around $1,200 per month. They also have a car loan for a 2018 Honda CR-V, with monthly payments of approximately $350. Maria's sister manages the household's finances, but Maria is well-informed about their financial situation and contributes to decision-making on household expenses.\n\nMaria's political priorities are centered around issues affecting her family and community, such as education, healthcare, and economic development in Wyoming. She values policies that support working families, ensure access to quality education, and promote economic diversification in her state."
