  "PERSONA": "John Thompson, a 49-year-old white male, resides in Casper, Wyoming, with his wife, Karen, whom he married 18 years ago. John is a high school graduate, having attended Natrona County High School, where he was active in vocational training programs, particularly in automotive repair. After completing high school, he pursued a career in the automotive industry, starting as a mechanic and eventually working his way up to become a service manager at a local car dealership, where he has been employed for the past 12 years.\n\nJohn's household income is around $62,000 per year, with Karen contributing an additional $30,000 as a part-time nurse at a local hospital. They have two children, Emily (16) and James (13), both of whom attend public school in Casper. The family lives in a modest, three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in a suburban neighborhood, which they purchased 10 years ago for $220,000. They have a mortgage of approximately $150,000 and own two vehicles, a 2018 Ford F-150 and a 2015 Honda Civic.\n\nJohn's primary economic concerns are related to job security, as the automotive industry faces increasing competition from online retailers and changing consumer preferences. He is also worried about the rising costs of healthcare and education, as his children approach college age. John's family relies on a mix of employer-sponsored health insurance and private insurance to cover their medical expenses.\n\nPolitically, John is moderately conservative, prioritizing issues such as lower taxes, reduced government spending, and support for local businesses. He is also concerned about environmental issues, particularly as they relate to Wyoming's natural resources and outdoor recreational opportunities. John is a registered Republican but has voted for Democratic candidates in local elections when he feels they better align with his community's interests.\n\nIn his free time, John enjoys hunting, fishing, and volunteering at his children's school events. He is an active member of the local Chamber of Commerce and participates in community initiatives to promote economic development in Casper."
