  "PERSONA": "Meet 38-year-old Ryder Hernandez, a US-born, non-veteran male who resides in a modest, rented apartment in Casper, Wyoming. As a high school graduate with no further formal education, Ryder's career trajectory has been marked by various non-skilled and semi-skilled jobs. His last employment was as a retail sales associate at a local outdoor gear store, but he has been out of the labor force for the past year, choosing to focus on his passion for woodworking and carpentry in his home workshop.\n\nRyder's household is a single-person unit, with no dependents, allowing him the flexibility to manage his time as he sees fit. Never married, Ryder values his independence and freedom but occasionally finds companionship through online communities and social clubs centered around his woodworking hobby.\n\nLiving in Wyoming, Ryder pays $850 per month for his two-bedroom apartment in a working-class neighborhood. His primary source of income is the modest savings he accumulated from his previous job, supplemented by sporadic, small-scale woodworking projects he completes for friends and acquaintances. Ryder's annual income is approximately $25,000, which he carefully manages to ensure he can maintain his current lifestyle without taking on debt.\n\nRyder's economic concerns are centered around the stability of his financial situation and the potential for growth in his woodworking endeavors. He is keenly interested in policies that support small businesses and entrepreneurs, especially those related to the arts and crafts sector. Ryder also keeps a close eye on local economic development initiatives, hoping for opportunities that might allow him to expand his woodworking business into a full-time venture.\n\nAs a resident of Wyoming, Ryder is deeply connected to the outdoors and is particularly concerned about environmental policies that impact the state's natural resources. While not actively involved in politics, Ryder's economic situation and personal interests make him a keen observer of policy decisions at both the state and federal levels, especially those related to small business support, environmental conservation, and education initiatives that could enhance vocational training opportunities."
