  "PERSONA": "Name: Alexis 'Lexi' Thompson, a 57-year-old, biracial (White and Black or African American) woman. She is married to her second husband, John, 60, and has been living with her parents, 82-year-old retired school teacher, Margaret, and 84-year-old retired mechanic, James, in their family home in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nResidence: The Thompsons reside in a cozy, three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in the historic downtown area of Cheyenne, which they own. Lexi's parents moved to this home 35 years ago, and she has been living with them for the past five years to care for them and manage the household.\n\nEconomic Situation: Lexi is currently not in the labor force, having taken a break from her career as a dental hygienist to care for her aging parents. Her husband, John, works part-time as a freelance writer, earning around $30,000 annually. Lexi's annual income from her previous job was around $60,000, and they have been living off their combined savings and John's income. They own the house outright, which they inherited from Lexi's grandparents, and have no mortgage payments. However, they do pay around $1,500 per month for utilities, groceries, and other living expenses.\n\nEducation: Lexi earned an Associate's degree in Dental Hygiene from Laramie County Community College in 1988. She worked as a dental hygienist for over 25 years before taking a break to care for her parents.\n\nFamily Structure: Lexi's parents, Margaret and James, are both retired and require assistance with daily tasks. Lexi's husband, John, has two adult children from his previous marriage, who live in different states and visit occasionally. Lexi has no children of her own.\n\nGeographic Location: Living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, has its economic implications. The cost of living is relatively low, but job opportunities are limited. Lexi's decision to care for her parents has restricted her ability to pursue full-time employment, but she values the time spent with her family.\n\nEconomic Concerns: Lexi's primary economic concern is ensuring her parents receive the care they need while maintaining a stable financial situation for herself and John. She worries about the rising costs of healthcare and the potential need for assisted living or nursing home care in the future. Additionally, she is concerned about the impact of her prolonged absence from the workforce on her future career prospects and retirement savings."
