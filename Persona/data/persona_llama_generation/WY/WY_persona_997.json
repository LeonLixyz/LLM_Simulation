Born in the United States, Maria Elena is a US citizen and has lived in Wyoming for the past 15 years. She is currently married but separated from her husband, who resides in a different part of the state due to work commitments.\n\nMaria Elena graduated from high school in New Mexico, where she grew up in a bilingual household speaking Spanish and English fluently. Despite her proficiency in English, she also speaks other Indo-European languages, including Portuguese, which she learned during her travels.\n\nAfter completing her education, Maria Elena worked as an administrative assistant in various sectors, including healthcare and education, for over 30 years.

The mortgage is almost paid off, and she is proud of her accomplishment. Her monthly expenses are relatively low, with the majority going towards utilities, groceries, and medication for her managed health conditions.\n\nAs a retired individual, Maria Elena's economic concerns focus on maintaining a stable income, managing healthcare costs, and ensuring the long-term security of her home. She is particularly interested in local policies that support affordable housing, public transportation, and accessible healthcare services for seniors.

She values her independence and is grateful for the opportunity to live a peaceful life in Cheyenne, surrounded by its small-town charm and the stunning Rocky Mountains."
