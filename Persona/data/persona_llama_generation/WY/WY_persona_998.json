  "PERSONA": "Alejandro \"Alex\" Hernandez, a 38-year-old White male, living in the city of Casper, Wyoming. Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Alex is a US citizen who speaks Spanish as his primary language but has limited English proficiency, often relying on family members or colleagues for translation in formal situations. \n\nMarried to his high school sweetheart, Maria, for about 10 years, Alex is a devoted husband and father of two children, ages 8 and 10, who currently live with his parents due to financial constraints. Alex's household is culturally traditional, with a strong emphasis on family ties and community. His wife, Maria, is also employed, working part-time as a medical assistant.\n\nAlex is a veteran who served in the US Army for six years, honorably discharged with the rank of Sergeant. After his military service, he struggled to find stable employment and eventually secured a job as a mechanic at a local auto repair shop in Casper, where he has been working for the past five years. His annual income is approximately $45,000, which, combined with his wife's income, allows them to make ends meet but leaves little room for savings or discretionary spending.\n\nAlex attended high school in New Mexico but did not graduate, instead choosing to join the military to gain discipline and career prospects. He has since pursued vocational training in automotive repair and is certified in diesel engine mechanics.\n\nThe family rents a modest three-bedroom house in a working-class neighborhood in Casper, paying about $1,200 per month. Alex's primary economic concerns include saving for his children's education, paying off his outstanding student loan debt from vocational school, and eventually buying a home. His experience as a veteran and a non-English proficient individual in a predominantly English-speaking state has shaped his views on healthcare access, veterans' benefits, and language support services."
