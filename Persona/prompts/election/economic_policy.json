She has taken the Biden administration stance on Social Security, supporting a measure to reinstate the payroll tax on earned income above $400,000. She has also said she would as president allow Medicare to accelerate negotiations on prescription drug prices, which are part of the administration's existing efforts to lower drug costs. In 2019, she co-sponsored a bill to expand Social Security by extending the payroll tax. She proposed a Medicare-for-All plan during her 2020 presidential bid, but she is not pursuing such a policy now."

But she broke with Biden on raising the capital gains tax rate, saying she supports a rate of 28 percent, compared with 44.6 percent for Biden, for those earning more than $1 million (the current rate is 23.6 percent). She also proposed expanding tax deductions for small businesses. She backs increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent and has promised not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 per year. She wants to restore and expand the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, including a $6,000 child tax credit for the first year of a newborn's life."
