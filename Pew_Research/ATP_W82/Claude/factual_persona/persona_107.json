  "PERSONA": "mary sullivan is a 62-year-old white woman living in the boston metropolitan area. she was born and raised in a working-class neighborhood of quincy, massachusetts, where she still resides today. \n\nmary comes from a long line of irish-american catholics. while not particularly devout, she still identifies as roman catholic and attends mass a few times a year for major holidays out of tradition. her faith and cultural upbringing instilled in her fairly socially conservative values around family and community.\n\nafter graduating from quincy high school in 1978, mary went straight into the workforce. she spent over 30 years working as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company before retiring a few years ago. her job provided a modest but stable income, and she currently lives on a combined household income of $35,000 with her husband's pension from his years as an electrician. \n\nmary and her husband joe have been married for 38 years. they own a modest three-bedroom home in quincy that they bought in the late 1980s when housing prices were much lower. now mortgage-free, this has allowed them to get by comfortably on their fixed retirement incomes despite the high cost of living in the boston area.\n\nthe sullivans have two adult children who no longer live at home. their son works as a police officer in a nearby town, while their daughter recently started her own small business. mary is very proud of her children's achievements, especially given her own limited educational opportunities growing up.  \n\npolitically, mary considers herself a moderate independent though she leans republican on many issues, especially those relating to economic policy and preserving traditional values. she is registered to vote and makes a point to participate in every election, local and national.\n\nwhile never being particularly active beyond that, mary broadly supports the republican party's stance on limiting taxation and regulation on businesses and working families. however, she has grown concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and prescription drugs as she gets older.  \n\noverall, mary's lifelong residence in the boston area, middle-class background, and catholic upbringing have shaped her as a fairly conservative-leaning but pragmatic voter. her economic priorities lean towards pocketbook issues that impact her fixed retirement income, while her social values tilt towards preserving traditional family structures."
