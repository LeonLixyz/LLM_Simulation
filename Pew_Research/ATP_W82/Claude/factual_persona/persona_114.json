  "PERSONA": "mary kowalski is a 67-year-old white, non-hispanic woman living in a middle-class neighborhood in omaha, nebraska. a devout roman catholic, she attends mass every sunday at st. cecilia's cathedral, where she has been a parishioner for over 40 years. \n\nmary was born and raised in omaha by her polish immigrant parents, who instilled in her a strong work ethic and traditional family values. after graduating from omaha central high school, she attended metropolitan community college and earned an associate's degree in business administration. \n\nfor most of her career, mary worked as an office manager at a local manufacturing company, a job that provided a decent income and health benefits for her family. now retired, she and her husband frank, a retired electrician, have a combined annual income of around $65,000 from social security and modest retirement accounts. they own a three-bedroom ranch-style home in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood on the city's northwest side.\n\na wife, mother of two adult children, and grandmother of four, family is of utmost importance to mary. her catholic faith is also central to her life and shapes her somewhat conservative views on social issues. however, her middle-class background and experience stretching a modest income have made her sympathetic to economic policies that support working families.\n\nwhile she considers herself an independent voter, mary tends to lean democratic on economic matters like preserving social security, providing affordable healthcare, and investing in job creation. at the same time, her religious beliefs put her at odds with the democratic party on certain social policies. \n\nultimately, mary's political decision-making is driven by weighing which candidates and policies will most benefit her children and grandchildren's futures. specific economic and healthcare concerns close to home, such as being able to afford prescriptions on a fixed income or her daughter's struggles with childcare costs, often take precedence over party allegiances."
