  "PERSONA": "meet robert johnson, a 68-year-old white man living in a middle-class neighborhood in des moines, iowa. after graduating high school, robert spent a few years working odd jobs before being hired at the local automobile manufacturing plant. he worked on the assembly line for over 40 years until his recent retirement. \n\nrobert has never been married and has no children. he lives alone in a modest two-bedroom house he purchased outright after years of saving. his monthly expenses mainly consist of utilities, property taxes, groceries, and medical costs covered by medicare and social security income of around $35,000 per year.\n\nhaving grown up in the midwest, robert holds traditional midwestern values of hard work, self-reliance, and fiscal responsibility. however, his decades as a union auto worker have also shaped his political leanings as more liberal, especially on economic issues. he supports policies that protect workers' rights, strengthen social safety nets, and make healthcare and education more affordable.\n\nwhile not particularly religious, robert aligns more with the republican party's stances on smaller government, low taxes, and strong national defense. yet he is turned off by the party's recent shift towards christian conservatism and opposition to programs like social security and medicare that he now relies on.\n\na moderate \"rockefeller republican,\" robert tends to vote based on the individual candidates and their proposed policies rather than strict party allegiance. in the upcoming election, he plans to research each candidate's economic platform and support those he feels will best uphold working-class interests while maintaining fiscal discipline.\n\nwhen not watching cable news or using the internet to research political issues, robert enjoys tending to his vegetable garden, going on daily walks around the neighborhood, and having an occasional beer at the local vfw hall with other retired auto workers like himself."
