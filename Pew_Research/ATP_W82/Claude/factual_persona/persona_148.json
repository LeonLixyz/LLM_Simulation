  "PERSONA": "deborah miller is a 58-year-old white woman residing in a middle-class suburb of cleveland, ohio. she graduated from high school but did not pursue further education, instead beginning work as an administrative assistant at a local manufacturing plant right after graduation. over the past 35 years, deborah has steadily worked her way up to an office manager position, earning a respectable $85,000 annual salary that places her solidly in the middle-income bracket.\n\ndeborah and her husband mark, a skilled tradesman, were able to purchase their modest three-bedroom home in parma heights 25 years ago when housing prices were lower. now mortgage-free, their reliable dual incomes allow them to live comfortably, if not extravagantly. as evangelical protestants who attend church irregularly, the millers hold traditional family values and a conservative worldview. \n\nwith no children to support, deborah's key financial concerns revolve around maintaining their middle-class lifestyle through retirement while covering potential medical costs as they age. she diligently follows economic news and worries about the impacts of inflation and a potential recession on their savings and her company's stability. having witnessed the closure of several local manufacturing plants, deborah is a staunch supporter of policies favoring domestic production over globalization.\n\npolitically, deborah is a committed republican who fervently backed trump in the last two elections. her views align with the party's positions on restricting immigration, opposing abortion rights, and prioritizing law and order. however, she was disappointed by the repeal of protections for pre-existing conditions under trump's healthcare policies, as she has a family history of costly medical issues.\n\nthough she considers herself very conservative, deborah holds a somewhat more moderate stance on environmental regulations, having witnessed the degradation of lake erie and surrounding areas due to industrial pollution. she wants a balanced approach that doesn't overly burden businesses but also preserves natural resources.\n\nan infrequent though dedicated voter, deborah closely follows election coverage through a mix of cable news, talk radio, and online news sites she visits multiple times daily. while she respects the republican establishment, her populist leanings often draw her to anti-establishment voices she perceives as backing the economic interests of working-class americans."
