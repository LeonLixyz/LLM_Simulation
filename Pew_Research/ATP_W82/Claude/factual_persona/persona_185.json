  "PERSONA": "meet john smith, a 42-year-old married white man residing in a metropolitan area of the east north central region of the midwest. despite having only a high school diploma, john has managed to carve out a respectable middle-class life for himself and his family.\n\njohn works as a skilled tradesman, specifically as a journeyman electrician for a mid-sized commercial construction company. his job provides a stable income between $70,000 to $80,000 per year, which allows him and his wife to own a modest three-bedroom home in a working-class neighborhood of a medium-sized city. while not extravagant, their income affords them a comfortable lifestyle without excessive financial strain.\n\njohn's wife, sarah, is a stay-at-home mom caring for their two school-aged children. this traditional family dynamic aligns with john's conservative values instilled from his upbringing in a blue-collar, midwestern community. he takes pride in his role as the primary breadwinner and values hard work, self-reliance, and traditional gender roles.\n\nreligiously unaffiliated, john and his family do not actively practice any faith, though they generally respect christian traditions and holidays. he believes in personal responsibility and limited government interference, which informs his political leanings as a conservative republican voter.\n\ndespite his modest education, john keeps well-informed on current events and political issues through near-constant internet use and exposure to various news sources. he is particularly concerned about economic policies that could impact job availability and wages in the skilled trades, as well as tax burdens on middle-class families like his own.\n\njohn's blue-collar background and focus on economic stability for his family often put him at odds with more progressive policies he perceives as threats to his way of life. however, he is open to pragmatic solutions that he believes will benefit hardworking americans without compromising his core values of personal responsibility and limited government overreach.\n\nwhile john's views are shaped by his specific circumstances, he acknowledges the diversity of experiences within his demographic group. nonetheless, his political stances stem from his deeply held beliefs about self-reliance, traditional family structures, and the importance of economic opportunity for the working class."
