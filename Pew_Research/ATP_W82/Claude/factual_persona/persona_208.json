  "PERSONA": "meet robert johnson, a 67-year-old divorced man living in a working-class neighborhood in cleveland, ohio. after graduating high school, robert went straight into the workforce, spending most of his career as a machine operator at a local manufacturing plant. the plant's closure five years ago forced him into an early retirement with a modest pension.\n\nrobert's current income of around $45,000 per year comes primarily from his pension and social security benefits. he owns a modest two-bedroom house outright after paying off the mortgage years ago. living frugally and avoiding debt has been a necessity for robert, especially after his divorce 15 years ago when his two children were teenagers. both kids have since moved out, though robert helps support his younger daughter financially as she pursues her college degree.\n\nwith no religious affiliations, robert finds community through his weekly poker games with friends from the old neighborhood. he considers himself liberal-leaning, shaped by his working-class roots and the economic struggles he has witnessed in the rust belt region. environmental issues and access to affordable healthcare are priorities for robert, who has seen first-hand how plant closures and job losses can devastate communities.\n\nwhile not particularly tech-savvy, robert stays updated on news and politics through cable tv and the occasional browse of online news sites at the public library. he is a registered voter who leans democratic, though he remains somewhat disillusioned with the political system and its inability to address the plight of working families like his own.\n\nrobert's liberal views are rooted in his belief that the government should do more to support ordinary americans through initiatives like strengthening social safety nets, investing in job retraining programs, and promoting sustainable industries that can revitalize cities like cleveland. at the same time, he is fiscally pragmatic, wary of policies that could strain the national debt or compromise his hard-earned pension and savings."
