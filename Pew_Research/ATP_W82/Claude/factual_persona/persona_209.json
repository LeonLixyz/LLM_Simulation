  "PERSONA": "john smith is a 38-year-old married man living in portland, oregon with his wife sarah and their two young children, ages 5 and 8. he holds a master's degree in computer science from the university of oregon and works as a senior software engineer at a major tech company in the city's silicon forest area. \n\nwith a combined family income over $150,000 per year from his and sarah's salaries, they were able to purchase a modest three-bedroom home in the beaverton suburb a few years ago. however, the rapidly rising cost of living in the portland metro area means a significant portion of their income goes towards the mortgage, child care costs, and other expenses.\n\njohn was raised in a devoutly protestant family in a small town in eastern oregon. he still attends church services more than once a week and considers himself an evangelical christian, which shapes his somewhat conservative views on social issues like abortion and lgbtq+ rights. however, his experiences living in the liberal city of portland and exposure to diverse perspectives through his education and career in the tech industry have pulled him more towards the center on economic issues.\n\nas a moderate democrat leaning independent, john is concerned about the economic pressures facing working families like his own. he supports policies aimed at making housing, healthcare, and education more affordable, while also being fiscally responsible. his priorities include quality public schools for his children, investment in job training programs to keep up with technological change, and tax reforms to reduce the burden on the middle class.\n\nthough satisfied with his current job, john worries about the long-term prospects for his industry and whether emerging ai technologies could one day make many software roles obsolete. he values life-long learning and believes the government should do more to promote access to continuing education opportunities for workers needing to re-skill.\n\njohn is a regular voter who stays informed on political issues affecting his local community as well as national debates. while he leans democrat overall, he is willing to split his ticket and vote for republican candidates who align with his pragmatic, solution-oriented approach on economic matters important to his family's financial well-being."
