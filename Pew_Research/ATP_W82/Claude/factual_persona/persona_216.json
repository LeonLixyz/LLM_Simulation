  "PERSONA": "meet anna kowalski, a 68-year-old white woman living in a small town in western minnesota. despite being a high school graduate, anna's limited education didn't stop her from carving out a fulfilling life for herself.\n\nanna was born in poland to a working-class catholic family who immigrated to the united states when she was in her late 20s. after arriving, she quickly found work at a local manufacturing plant, where she spent over 30 years on the assembly line before retiring a few years ago. her job provided a modest but stable income that allowed her and her husband, jan, to purchase a small three-bedroom home in their town's quiet residential neighborhood.\n\nnow retired, anna's days consist of tending to her vegetable garden, watching her favorite game shows, and looking after her two young grandchildren a couple of days a week while their parents are at work. though money was tight when she and jan were raising their own children, they managed to put away enough to cover their basic living expenses in retirement.  \n\nas a lifelong democrat and practicing catholic, anna's political views are shaped by her working-class roots and traditional values. she believes strongly in the importance of stable jobs, affordable healthcare, and maintaining a social safety net for those in need. at the same time, her faith leads her to hold somewhat conservative stances on social issues like abortion and lgbtq+ rights.\n\nliving in a tight-knit rural community, anna is deeply patriotic and proud of her adopted homeland, even if she still maintains some of her polish culinary traditions. she makes a point of voting in every election, as she sees it as both a privilege and a responsibility of citizenship. while not particularly active in local politics, she pays close attention to national issues and candidates that could impact her children's and grandchildren's futures.\n\nin recent years, anna has grown concerned about the state of the economy and its effects on working families like her own. she worries that younger generations won't have the same opportunities for stable, well-paying jobs in industries like manufacturing. at the same time, the rising cost of living, especially for healthcare, weighs heavily on her mind as she manages her fixed retirement income.\n\nultimately, anna's political decision-making is guided by an innate sense of fairness and a desire to protect the traditional working-class way of life that allowed her family to get ahead. she tends to favor democratic candidates who prioritize economic security, while still aligning with some of the party's more moderate or conservative stances on social issues. above all, anna wants to see policies that will create better opportunities for her grandchildren and ensure they can achieve their version of the american dream."
