  "PERSONA": "jada williams is a 58-year-old african american woman living in a small town in rural tennessee. she never married and has no children, living alone in a modest rental apartment. \n\njada grew up in the same town she resides in now. after high school, she attended the local community college and earned an associate's degree in business administration. however, job opportunities were limited in her area, so she took whatever work she could find over the years - retail clerk, restaurant server, office assistant. her current job is as a receptionist at a doctor's office, earning around $25,000 per year.\n\nwith her low income, jada has had to be very careful with finances. she drives an old but reliable used car and cooks most of her meals at home to save money. while she dreams of one day owning a small house, the upfront costs and maintenance seem out of reach on her tight budget. her biggest economic concerns are making ends meet, having enough for retirement, and the rising costs of healthcare and prescriptions as she gets older.\n\njada was raised in a devoutly baptist family, but over time she drifted away from organized religion and now considers herself non-religious or unaffiliated. her political views lean moderately democratic, shaped by her economic struggles and the challenges faced by her local community. however, she holds some socially conservative values as well. \n\na lifelong resident of her small town, jada takes pride in its tight-knit community spirit. she values hard work and self-reliance instilled by her upbringing. at the same time, she believes the government has a role in supporting those in need and creating economic opportunities, especially in rural areas. while not passionate about politics, she is a reliable democratic voter, relating more to that party's stance on economic issues impacting the working class."
