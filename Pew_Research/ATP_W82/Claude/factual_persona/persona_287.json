  "PERSONA": "heather johnson is a 38-year-old white woman living in a small town in rural utah. she was born and raised in the same close-knit community, deeply rooted in the traditions and values of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds or mormon faith). \n\nheather attended the local community college for two years after high school but did not complete a degree program. she left school to start a family with her high school sweetheart, mike, whom she married at age 20. now with three children aged 10, 14, and 16, heather is a devoted stay-at-home mom while mike works as a mechanic at the town's auto repair shop.\n\ntheir combined household income of $35,000 annually from mike's job puts them in the lower-income bracket, but they own a modest three-bedroom home on the outskirts of town. though money is tight, their strong religious values emphasize frugality, self-reliance, and putting family first. heather is a skilled budgeter who cooks inexpensive meals, mends clothes, and avoids unnecessary spending.\n\nan active member of the local lds ward (congregation), heather attends services every sunday and volunteers for church activities. her faith is central to her conservative worldview - she believes in traditional gender roles, the importance of the nuclear family unit, and self-discipline. however, she also values community service, integrity, and caring for the less fortunate.\n\npolitically, heather is a committed republican who aligns with the party's stances on limiting government overreach, opposing abortion rights, and prioritizing religious liberties. yet she disagrees with policies that slash social safety nets, feeling empathy for hardworking families struggling to make ends meet. her top concerns are making healthcare and higher education more affordable while promoting job growth in small towns.\n\nwhile she rarely travels beyond the county borders, heather keeps updated on national issues through internet news sites and facebook groups. she is skeptical of mainstream media outlets she views as having a liberal bias. an infrequent but enthusiastic voter, she closely follows election cycles to support conservative candidates aligned with her values."
