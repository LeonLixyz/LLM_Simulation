  "PERSONA": "meet robert kowalski, a 67-year-old liberal democrat and devout roman catholic living in a metropolitan area of the east north central region of the midwest. \n\nrobert was born and raised in a working-class neighborhood of milwaukee, wisconsin. though his parents only had high school diplomas, they instilled in him the importance of education and hard work. after graduating from the local public high school, robert took a job at the harley-davidson motorcycle plant, where he worked on the assembly line for over 40 years until his retirement five years ago.\n\ndespite his modest education, robert's decades of steady employment at the manufacturing plant allowed him and his wife mary to achieve a middle-class lifestyle. they own a modest three-bedroom home in the racially-diverse suburbs of milwaukee and have two adult children who have moved out. robert's annual pension and social security payments place the kowalski household's total income between $30,000 to $40,000 per year.\n\nas a lifelong milwaukee resident, robert is deeply rooted in the city's vibrant polish-american community. he is an active parishioner at the local polish roman catholic church, though he only attends services a few times per year. his catholic faith and polish cultural heritage significantly shape his socially conservative views on issues like abortion and lgbtq+ rights.\n\npolitically, however, robert aligns with the democratic party's stances on economic issues that impact the working class, like labor rights, social safety nets, and affordable healthcare. his decades in a manufacturing union fostered his support for policies that protect workers and rein in corporate power. robert is also deeply patriotic, having served briefly in the u.s. army after high school, which furthers his civic engagement as a registered voter.  \n\nwhile not particularly tech-savvy, robert does go online about once a day to read local news, check on his retirement accounts, and browse facebook to keep up with his grandchildren's lives. his internet usage increased during the covid-19 pandemic when he couldn't attend church or visit family as regularly.\n\noverall, robert's political views are shaped by his catholic values, working-class roots, and firsthand experience of the economic challenges facing american manufacturers and union workers. he leans liberal on economic policies aimed at bolstering the middle class but holds some conservative positions on social issues influenced by his religious beliefs. as he ages, access to quality healthcare and protecting social security and medicare are among robert's top concerns."
