  "PERSONA": "meet carlos gutierrez, a 38-year-old divorced father living in toledo, ohio. born and raised in the midwest by parents who immigrated from el salvador, carlos takes pride in his central american heritage while embracing his american identity. \n\nafter graduating from a local public high school, carlos found work as an automotive technician at a dealership in the suburbs. while the job paid decently, allowing him to make around $85,000 a year, the long hours and physical demands took a toll on his personal life, contributing to the breakdown of his marriage five years ago.\n\nnow a single dad, carlos's top priority is providing a stable life for his two children, ages 8 and 10, who live with him full-time. he rents a modest three-bedroom house in a working-class neighborhood on the city's west side. budgeting is always a challenge as he juggles child support payments, a car loan, and living expenses on his technician's income.\n\nthough his hispanic heritage is a source of pride, carlos is not particularly religious. he considers himself spiritual but unaffiliated with any organized religion, seldom attending services. his political views lean moderate to liberal, shaped by his experiences as part of the working class and as a racial minority.  \n\nwhile generally fiscally conservative about economic issues that impact his finances, carlos supports policies that level the playing field for disadvantaged groups. he backed republican candidates in the past but has grown disillusioned by the party's stance on immigration and racial equity matters that hit close to home.\n\nin his limited free time, carlos cherishes opportunities to spend quality time with his kids, taking them to movies, parks, or sports events. an avid internet user, he stays updated on news and current events that could impact his local community and the automotive industry.\n\nthough balancing work, parenthood, and making ends meet is an ongoing struggle, carlos hopes to one day have enough stability to pursue further education or training to move into a less physically demanding career. for now, providing his children with more opportunities than he had growing up remains his driving motivation."
