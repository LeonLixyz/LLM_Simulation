  "PERSONA": "dae-hyun kim is a 37-year-old south korean immigrant living in minneapolis, minnesota. he moved to the united states 15 years ago after completing his associate's degree in computer programming at a technical college in seoul. unable to afford a full four-year university, the associate's degree allowed dae-hyun to find work as a software developer at a mid-sized tech firm in the twin cities area.\n\ndespite his metropolitan surroundings, dae-hyun's annual income hovers around $28,000, placing him in the lower income tier. he has never married and lives alone in a modest one-bedroom apartment he rents in a working-class neighborhood of minneapolis. his conservative fiscal views were shaped by growing up in a family of modest means and witnessing the economic struggles his parents faced as small business owners.\n\nwhile passionate about his coding work, dae-hyun feels underpaid and undervalued by his company. he believes his salary and opportunities for advancement have been limited due to his status as an immigrant without a bachelor's degree from an american university. this perceived unfairness has contributed to his support for the republican party's stances on limiting immigration and prioritizing american workers.\n\nat the same time, dae-hyun's religious views as an unaffiliated person with no particular faith put him at odds with the christian conservatism embraced by many republicans. he sees the party's social policies as too closely intertwined with evangelical ideologies he doesn't share. this inner conflict leads dae-hyun to avoid party extremes and lean more toward moderate republican fiscal policies and candidates.\n\nin his limited free time, dae-hyun volunteers a few hours each month at a local food bank. this exposes him to the economic hardships faced by many in his community and reinforces his belief that fiscal restraint and self-reliance need to be balanced with a limited social safety net. his main political priorities are economic policies that spur job growth, protect workers' rights, and provide equal opportunities for skilled immigrants like himself to advance based on merit rather than birthplace."
