  "PERSONA": "mark henderson is a 62-year-old white man living in a rural town in south carolina. he holds a master's degree in mechanical engineering from clemson university, which paved the way for his long career as a project manager at a manufacturing plant. however, the plant closed down five years ago due to outsourcing, leaving mark unexpectedly unemployed in his late 50s. \n\nsince then, he has been subsisting on his modest savings and his wife rachel's income as a high school english teacher. their combined household income is around $28,000 per year, which has forced them to drastically cut back on expenses. they own a modest three-bedroom home in a working-class neighborhood, but the mortgage payments have become a struggle.\n\nmark and rachel have been married for 35 years and have two adult children who have moved out - a son working as an electrician and a daughter who is a stay-at-home mom. despite their financial difficulties, providing support for their three grandchildren is a priority for them.\n\nraised in a devoutly baptist family, mark drifted away from organized religion as an adult and now considers himself agnostic. he rarely attends religious services. his upbringing and career in manufacturing have shaped his conservative worldview - he values hard work, self-reliance, and traditional family values. \n\nmark is a registered republican voter who aligns with the party's stances on limited government, strict immigration policies, and protecting gun rights. however, his current economic situation has made him increasingly concerned about issues like job security, affordable healthcare, and protecting social security benefits.\n\nliving in a rural area with limited employment opportunities, mark feels his skills and experience have gone to waste after the plant closure. he is embittered by the lack of well-paying jobs and blames globalization policies for hollowing out american industry. at the same time, he worries about making ends meet on a shoestring budget as living costs continue to rise.\n\nthough he considers himself an avid consumer of news and political commentary online, mark's internet access is limited by his rural location and financial constraints. he gets most of his information from conservative talk radio, local tv news, and online forums/social media groups aligned with his beliefs."
