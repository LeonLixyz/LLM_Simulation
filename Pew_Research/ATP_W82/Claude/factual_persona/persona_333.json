  "PERSONA": "meet robert smith, a 56-year-old white man living in a working-class neighborhood in cleveland, ohio. robert never attended college, having graduated from high school and gone straight into the workforce. he has been employed for over 30 years as a machine operator at a local manufacturing plant, but his modest income of around $28,000 per year classifies him as lower-income.\n\nnever married and without children, robert lives alone in a rented one-bedroom apartment. his simple lifestyle affords few luxuries, but he takes pride in his independence and self-reliance. despite his financial constraints, robert makes an effort to stay informed, frequently browsing news websites and discussing current events with coworkers during breaks.\n\nraised in a nominally christian household, robert drifted away from organized religion as an adult and now considers himself unaffiliated with any particular faith. his moderate political views lean democratic, shaped by his working-class roots and concerns about economic security for ordinary americans. however, he remains skeptical of what he perceives as excessive government overreach or taxation.\n\nwhile robert feels politically independent, he tends to favor democratic candidates who prioritize policies that protect jobs, affordable healthcare, and a social safety net. at the same time, his socially conservative leanings sometimes put him at odds with the progressive wing of the party. overall, robert's political opinions are shaped by his personal experiences navigating an economically precarious situation as a blue-collar worker without a college degree.\n\nliving in the heart of a key swing state, robert closely follows national elections and debates. he values pragmatism over ideological purity and is drawn to candidates he sees as reasonable moderates, regardless of party affiliation. above all, robert cares about securing better prospects for hardworking americans like himself in an increasingly globalized economy."
