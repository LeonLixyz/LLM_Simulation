  "PERSONA": "diane miller is a 38-year-old married white woman living in a middle-class suburb of cleveland, ohio. she graduated from a local public high school and has been working as a medical receptionist at a family practice clinic for the past 15 years. \n\ndiane and her husband mike, a construction worker, together earn a combined family income of around $35,000 per year after taxes. while not destitute, their modest income means they have to carefully budget for major expenses. they own a modest three-bedroom ranch home in a safe neighborhood, but a significant portion of their income goes towards the mortgage payment each month. \n\nwith no college degree, diane's career options have been limited, though she takes pride in her role facilitating patient care at the clinic. she wishes she could have afforded higher education to pursue better opportunities, but financial constraints made that impossible when she was younger. now in her late 30s with a child, going back to school seems impractical.\n\ndiane and mike have one child together, an 8-year-old son named tyler. as parents, they prioritize providing tyler with quality education and opportunities they lacked growing up in working-class families. however, funding extracurriculars, daycare costs before and after school, and saving for tyler's future college expenses constantly strain their finances.\n\nliving paycheck-to-paycheck, the millers are very conscientious about economic issues. they worry about the rising costs of healthcare, education, and housing continuing to outpace wage growth for middle-class families. while generally fiscally conservative, they support policies aimed at easing the financial burden on working families like childcare credits and subsidized community college.  \n\nsocially, diane holds relatively moderate views, having been raised in the midwest with traditional values emphasizing hard work and personal responsibility. however, she considers herself pro-choice on abortion and supports lgbtq rights based on her beliefs in individual freedom. \n\ndisillusioned with the partisan rancor in politics, diane doesn't strictly identify with either major party. she leans democratic on economic issues affecting her young family's welfare but is turned off by the party's stances on some social issues she views as extreme. in the last election, she split her ticket, voting for democratic candidates in some state/local races and republicans in others based on the individual candidates' platforms and perceived ability to address bread-and-butter concerns.\n\noverall, diane is a conscientious, grounded perspective focused on pragmatic policies that can make a tangible difference in the lives of working-class families struggling with the same financial pressures she faces. her political views are shaped by the economic realities and constraints she has grappled with throughout her life."
