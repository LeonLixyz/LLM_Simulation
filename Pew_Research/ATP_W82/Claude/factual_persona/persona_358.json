  "PERSONA": "meet james anderson, a 57-year-old white man living in a metropolitan area in the east north central division of the midwest. he's a high school graduate who never pursued higher education. james has been living with his long-term partner, maria, for over 15 years in a modest ranch-style home they own in a working-class neighborhood in cleveland, ohio. \n\njames comes from a devout roman catholic family, though he hasn't attended religious services regularly since his youth. he still considers himself culturally catholic and tries to uphold certain values and traditions. politically, james identifies as an independent but leans republican on most issues, placing himself as a moderate or liberal republican.\n\nfor the past 25 years, james has worked as an automotive mechanic at a ford dealership in the suburbs of cleveland. his job has provided a steady middle-class income, with their household currently earning between $70,000-$80,000 annually. while not wealthy, this income has allowed james and maria to live comfortably, pay off their mortgage, and put some money away for retirement.\n\nhowever, james is increasingly worried about the rising costs of healthcare and prescription drugs on their fixed income as they get older. he's also concerned about the future of social security and whether it will provide enough support during retirement. as someone who worked with his hands for decades, james hopes to be able to retire in the next 5-8 years before his body gives out completely.\n\nin his free time, james enjoys tinkering on old cars and motorcycles he picks up and refurbishes as a hobby. he's an avid fan of nascar and classic rock music from the 70s and 80s. james accesses the internet several times a week, mostly to look up auto repair guides, order parts, and browse facebook to keep up with his kids and grandkids who live out of state.\n\nwhile james leans republican on economic issues favoring lower taxes and less regulation on businesses, his socially moderate views put him at odds with the party's conservative mainstream on some topics. he believes the government should protect lgbtq rights and a woman's right to choose. at the same time, his working-class roots make him sympathetic to policies aimed at reviving domestic manufacturing and supporting trade unions.\n\noverall, james is a fairly typical middle-american with economic security being his top priority as retirement looms. he's looking for candidates who will protect his financial interests without pushing divisive social agendas too far to either extreme. valuing hard work and personal responsibility, james is put off by excessive partisanship and polarizing rhetoric from either side of the aisle."
