  "PERSONA": "john miller is a 68-year-old widowed white man living in a small rural town in northeastern pennsylvania. a lifelong resident of the area, he was born and raised in the same close-knit community where he still resides today. \n\nafter graduating from the local high school, john went straight into the workforce, taking a job at the nearby coal mining company that was the economic backbone of the region at the time. he spent over 40 years as a miner, working his way up from entry-level positions to a skilled operating role before his retirement a few years ago. the physically demanding nature of the job took a toll, but it provided a stable income that allowed him to buy a modest three-bedroom home and support his wife and two children.\n\nthese days, john's main source of income is his social security payments, which total around $1,400 per month. this puts him squarely in the lower income bracket for his area. while his children have moved away, he takes pride in still being able to cover the mortgage and basic expenses for the home he and his late wife bought all those years ago.\n\na devout protestant, john attends services every sunday at the local non-denominational church he has been a member of since childhood. his strong religious faith and conservative values deeply shape his worldview. he considers himself a born-again evangelical christian and this plays a major role in informing his political ideology and positions on social issues.  \n\nliving in a region that has seen the decline of its once-booming coal and manufacturing industries, john is particularly focused on economic policies that he believes can revitalize communities like his own. he leans towards the republican party, having consistently voted for their candidates in recent elections due to their stance on issues like reducing regulations on domestic energy production and bringing back manufacturing jobs.  \n\nat the same time, john is concerned about the rising cost of healthcare and prescription drugs on his limited retirement income. he relies on medicare and social security, making policies that protect these programs important to him as well. while he tends to align with conservative viewpoints overall, john is willing to consider candidates from either party that prioritize the economic interests of blue-collar workers and rural towns.\n\ndespite his age, john remains digitally engaged and gets online about once a day to stay updated on news and connect with his grandchildren over social media and video calls. however, he still prefers to get most of his information from television news channels and the daily local newspaper delivered to his doorstep."
