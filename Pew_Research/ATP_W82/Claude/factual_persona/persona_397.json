  "PERSONA": "james walker is a 58-year-old divorced man living in a small town in central illinois. he was born and raised in the same rural county, coming from a working-class family with mixed european and native american ancestry.  \n\nafter graduating from the local high school, james went straight into the workforce. he spent most of his career as a machine operator at a manufacturing plant, working on the assembly line for over 30 years until the factory closed down five years ago due to outsourcing. he has been unemployed since then, struggling to find a new job at his age with just a high school diploma.\n\nwith his limited income of around $22,000 per year from unemployment benefits and modest savings, james lives a frugal lifestyle in the ranch-style house he inherited from his parents. he does basic home repairs and maintenance himself to save money. his two adult children, who both moved out of state for college and better job prospects, help support him financially when they can.\n\nliving in a rural exurb about an hour's drive from the nearest mid-size city, james has few employment options locally beyond retail and fast food service jobs that pay minimum wage. the lack of public transportation in his area is also a major barrier. he relies on his aging truck to get around, dreading the day it breaks down for good.\n\npolitically, james considers himself a moderate independent, though he leans democratic on many issues. his main priorities are economic - bringing back manufacturing jobs to his community, reducing the cost of living, and safeguarding social security/medicare for his impending retirement. while not particularly religious, james holds some socially conservative values instilled from his blue-collar upbringing.\n\nhe sees the internet as a useful tool for job searches, researching candidates, and staying informed on current events through online news sites. however, he is wary of potential misinformation and privacy concerns with excessive internet use.\n\njames hopes that whoever gets elected will focus on reviving small-town america and creating more opportunities for working-class folks like himself. while not overtly political, he makes a point of voting in every election as he sees it as his civic duty as an american citizen."
