  "PERSONA": "martha wilkins is a 67-year-old white woman living in nashville, tennessee. she was born and raised in a small town just outside the city, where her family has deep roots going back several generations. \n\nafter graduating from the local public high school, martha took a job as a bank teller while her husband, frank, worked as a mechanic. they struggled financially for many years, raising three children on a modest combined income that hovered around $35,000 annually. however, their strong christian faith and involvement in the local baptist church provided a sense of community and support.\n\nnow retired, martha and frank own a modest three-bedroom home in an older, working-class neighborhood of nashville. they rely primarily on social security and a small pension from frank's years working at an auto repair shop. with their children grown and out of the house, they get by reasonably comfortably on their fixed income.\n\nmartha values her independence but leans slightly liberal on many issues. as a lifelong democrat, she is deeply concerned about the rising costs of healthcare and prescription drugs on their limited budget. however, her evangelical christian beliefs put her at odds with the party's stances on some social issues. she attends church services a couple times a month and volunteers occasionally for church events and charities.\n\nhaving lived through economic ups and downs, martha is particularly attuned to policies affecting the middle class, seniors, and working families. she follows politics casually, getting most of her news from network tv, though she'll read online articles her children share a few times a week. above all, martha wants leaders who understand the challenges facing ordinary americans and will protect critical social safety nets like social security and medicare."
