  "PERSONA": "meet robert johnson, a 57-year-old white man from a small town in central ohio. he was born and raised in the same rural community, where his family has lived for generations. after graduating from the local high school, robert went straight into the workforce, finding a job at the nearby automotive manufacturing plant.\n\nfor over 35 years, robert has worked as a skilled assembly line worker at the plant, specializing in the installation of vehicle interiors. despite only having a high school diploma, his decades of experience and commitment to his job have allowed him to earn a comfortable upper-income salary exceeding $100,000 per year. however, the recent economic downturn and threat of outsourcing have made him increasingly anxious about the future of his job and the community's primary employer.\n\nrobert is a married man and the sole breadwinner for his family. his wife, sarah, is a homemaker who takes care of their modest three-bedroom home in the town's working-class neighborhood. they have two adult children who have moved out, but they often help support their youngest son financially as he struggles to find stable employment after dropping out of college.\n\nas a lifelong resident of the area, robert takes pride in his midwestern values of hard work, self-reliance, and traditional family structures. he is a devout protestant who attends church services occasionally, though not as frequently as he did in his younger years. his faith and conservative upbringing have shaped his worldview, leading him to hold firm beliefs in limited government, traditional gender roles, and the importance of personal responsibility.\n\npolitically, robert is a registered republican voter who consistently leans conservative on most issues. he is deeply concerned about the economic challenges facing his community, particularly the potential loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs and the strain it puts on working-class families like his own. as such, he tends to favor policies that prioritize job creation, protect american industries, and limit immigration, which he perceives as a threat to employment opportunities for native-born workers.\n\nat the same time, robert values his financial security and the benefits he has earned through his long-term employment, making him wary of any proposals that could jeopardize his pension or healthcare coverage. he is also skeptical of government overreach and excessive regulations, which he believes can stifle business growth and innovation.\n\nwhile robert is a frequent internet user, keeping up with news and current events online, he remains distrustful of mainstream media sources, which he perceives as biased and out of touch with the concerns of working-class americans like himself. instead, he tends to gravitate toward more conservative-leaning outlets and social media circles that align with his values and validate his economic anxieties.\n\ndespite his generally conservative leanings, robert is not dogmatic in his political views and is open to supporting candidates or policies that he believes will genuinely improve the lives of hardworking americans like himself, regardless of party affiliation. however, his primary focus remains on safeguarding his economic security, preserving his community's way of life, and ensuring a stable future for his family and those who share his values and circumstances."
