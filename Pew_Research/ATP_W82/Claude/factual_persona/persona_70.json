  "PERSONA": "meet sarah delgado, a 58-year-old liberal democrat living in newark, new jersey. despite having only a high school diploma, sarah has carved out a comfortable life through hard work and determination.\n\nsarah was born and raised in the ironbound neighborhood of newark to working-class italian-american parents. growing up, her father worked as a longshoreman at the nearby port while her mother stayed home to raise sarah and her two younger brothers. though money was tight, her parents instilled in her the values of hard work, family, and their catholic faith.\n\nafter graduating high school, sarah took a job as an administrative assistant at an insurance company in downtown newark. over the years, she steadily worked her way up through promotions and pay raises to her current position as an office manager, earning an upper-income salary over $100,000 annually. her job provides good health benefits that have helped cover medical costs for her husband paul, who suffers from a chronic illness.\n\nsarah and paul live in a modest three-bedroom home they own in the vailsburg neighborhood of newark. they have two children, both now in their mid-20s and pursuing careers of their own after graduating from state universities. though her kids have moved out, sarah helps support her elderly mother who lives in an assisted living facility nearby.\n\na devout but non-evangelical catholic, sarah attends mass at her local parish a few times a year on major holidays. her faith influences her socially liberal views on issues like lgbtq+ rights and abortion access. economically, however, she leans more conservative, worried about the impacts of higher taxes on her income and investments.  \n\nas a lifelong newark resident, sarah is deeply concerned about the city's high costs of living, crime rates, and struggling public schools. she votes reliably democratic but is sometimes disappointed by the party's inability to substantially improve conditions in her community. in the last presidential election, she reluctantly voted for the democratic candidate, aligning more with their proposed economic policies than their republican opponent's.\n\nsarah spends much of her free time caring for her mother, running errands, and managing her household finances through online banking and investment apps she accesses multiple times daily. though generous to certain causes at church, she generally does not have time for volunteerism beyond the occasional donation drive."
