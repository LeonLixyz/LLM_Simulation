  "PERSONA": "meet sarah wilson, a 58-year-old white woman living in a small town in rural south carolina. despite having only a high school diploma, sarah has worked hard her entire life to provide for her family. \n\nafter graduating, sarah took a job as a cashier at the local grocery store, where she met her husband, frank. they married young and started a family, with sarah taking a few years off to be a stay-at-home mom to their two children. once the kids were in school, sarah returned to the workforce, taking on various retail and service jobs to supplement frank's income as a construction worker.\n\ntoday, the wilsons are empty nesters living in the modest three-bedroom home they bought over 25 years ago. their combined income from sarah's part-time job at a local diner and frank's construction gig puts them squarely in the lower-income bracket, bringing in just under $30,000 annually. while money is tight, they've paid off their mortgage and have minimal debt beyond utilities and groceries.\n\ndevout protestants, the wilsons are active members of their local baptist church, attending services a few times a year for major holidays. their faith and traditional values are central to their worldview, shaping their socially conservative leanings. however, sarah's own struggles with making ends meet have inclined her more toward moderate economic policies that she feels could benefit working-class families like hers.\n\nliving in a rural area with limited employment opportunities, one of sarah's primary concerns is the availability of well-paying jobs that don't require advanced degrees. while she encourages her grandchildren to pursue higher education, she understands that path isn't for everyone. she wants policies that create opportunities for decent blue-collar work.  \n\nsarah is also deeply troubled by the rising cost of healthcare and prescription drugs. with her husband nearing retirement age and some chronic health issues of her own, she worries about being able to afford quality care on a fixed income. she supports measures to make healthcare more affordable and accessible, especially for seniors.\n\npolitically, sarah considers herself an independent but tends to lean democratic on economic issues, while siding more with republicans on social policies aligned with her religious beliefs. she is a registered voter who follows national news and politics online several times a day.\n\noverall, sarah's political views are shaped by her personal experiences growing up in a working-class family, her economic status and challenges, her strong faith, and her desire for policies that create economic opportunities and a social safety net for ordinary americans like herself."
