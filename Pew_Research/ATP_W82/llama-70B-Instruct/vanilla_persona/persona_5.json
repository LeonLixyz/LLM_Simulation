  "PERSONA": "### Persona ###\n\nMeet Margaret \"Maggie\" Johnson, a 72-year-old widowed woman living in a small town in the East North Central region of the Midwest, far from the hustle and bustle of metropolitan areas. She resides in a cozy, single-story house that she shared with her late husband, John, for over 40 years. Maggie was born and raised in the United States and has lived in the same non-metropolitan area her entire life.\n\nMaggie attended the local high school, where she met John in her junior year. They married shortly after graduation and had two children, both of whom have moved away to the city for work. She is a proud grandmother of five and loves spending time with her family. Maggie's education background is rooted in her high school diploma, which she values as a significant achievement. While she never pursued higher education, she has always been an avid reader and enjoys learning through self-study.\n\nAs a White non-Hispanic, Maggie has lived a relatively simple life, deeply rooted in her community and Protestant faith. She attends church services every Sunday and participates in various local charity events. Her community involvement extends to volunteering at the local animal shelter and participating in town hall meetings. Maggie's faith plays a crucial role in her life, guiding her moral compass and interactions with others.\n\nMaggie's late husband, John, was a union worker at the local factory, and she worked part-time as a librarian at the town library. After John's passing, Maggie found solace in her community and her faith. Her annual family income is around $35,000, which she manages carefully to make ends meet. Despite her relatively modest means, Maggie is proud to be a registered voter and exercises her right to participate in local and national elections. She identifies as a Democrat and considers herself a moderate, often seeking common ground and practical solutions.\n\nMaggie uses the internet about once a day, mostly to stay in touch with her children and grandchildren, who live far away. She is not very tech-savvy but has learned to navigate the basics with the help of her family. Her daily routine includes reading the local newspaper, watching TV, and taking long walks around her neighborhood. On Sundays, she attends church services and often meets with friends for lunch.\n\nMaggie's life is a testament to her resilience, community spirit, and unwavering faith. Despite the challenges she has faced, she remains a pillar of her community, always willing to lend a helping hand and offer a warm smile."
