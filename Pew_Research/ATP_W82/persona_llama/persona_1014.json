  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nMin-Jae (MJ) Park, a 25-year-old, identifies as non-binary and is of Asian-American ethnicity, specifically of Korean descent. MJ was born in Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, and has spent most of their life moving between different U.S. territories due to their parents' military careers. They have lived in the continental United States for about 7 years, currently residing in the Nashville-Davidson metropolitan area in Tennessee, a part of the East South Central census division. \n\nMJ lives in a modest two-bedroom apartment with their parents and younger sibling in the-hopkinsville neighborhood which has a mix of single-family homes, condominiums, and apartment complexes. Their parents have been leasing the property for about 3 years at a monthly rent of $1,400. MJ helps with household expenses by contributing $800 each month from their income.\n\nWith a high school diploma from a public school in their previous neighborhood, MJ's education level is a high school graduate or less, although they initially started at a local community college but decided to pursue a full-time job instead due to family financial constraints. They currently work as a customer service representative at a marketing firm, earning about $62,000 a year. Their job does not require a college degree but prioritizes excellent communication skills and product knowledge, both of which MJ has honed over the years. However, they are now looking to start taking courses online to enhance their prospects.\n\nMJ's family income category falls under $60,000 to less than $70,000, and given their income contribution and living situation, they identify as middle-income earners. They are not a U.S. citizen, having a U.S. territory passport from Guam, although they have a work visa that allows them to legally work in the mainland.\n\nMJ practices Roman Catholicism and attends mass on Sundays. They are spiritually inclined but open to exploring other faiths and find solace in the sense of community at their local church. On weekends, MJ often volunteers at the church, participating in youth outreach and charity programs, fostering a strong sense of social responsibility despite checking 'no' for volunteerism status in a previous survey due to not participating outside their church activities. \n\nMJ uses the internet about once a day, mostly for work, connecting with friends and family, and staying updated on news and trends. They are interested in economic policies that promote social welfare and middle-class growth. Due to their personal experiences with higher education costs and housing, MJ leans towards Democratic policies but finds the conservative approach to fiscal policy appealing, leading them to identify as a moderate to conservative-leaning Democrat who is not registered to vote due to immigration status complexities.\n\nThough MJ faces daily challenges as a non-binary, first-generation mainland U.S. resident and a non-citizen, they remain optimistic about their future in America, believing in its potential for opportunity and their ability to contribute positively to society."
