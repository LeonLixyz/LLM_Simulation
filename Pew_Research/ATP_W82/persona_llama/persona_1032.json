  "PERSONA": "meet john, a 57-year-old widowed man living in the midwest, specifically in a metropolitan area of des moines, iowa. born and raised in the united states, john identifies as white non-hispanic. he holds a high school diploma but didn't attend college due to his family's financial situation at the time. \n\njohn works as a facilities manager in a local school district, earning a steady income of $55,000 per year. his job is crucial for maintaining the school buildings and supporting the educational infrastructure. although his job is fulfilling, he has grown increasingly concerned about tight school budgets and how they might affect his job security.\n\nas a conservative republican, john believes in small government, lower taxes, and conservative social values. he is registered to vote and casts his ballot in every election cycle. while he leans heavily on traditional institutions and values, john rarely attends church services, instead identifying as having no particular religion. this perspective is partly due to his wife's passing five years ago, which has led to a reevaluation of his spiritual beliefs.\n\njohn lives alone in a modest two-story house he owned with his late wife. their house is in a quiet neighborhood filled with family homes and a mix of old and young couples. before his wife passed away, they had built a cozy and welcoming home environment, but now the house feels somewhat empty, especially when he comes home from his evening routine. the neighborhood has been changing slowly over the years, with some houses seeing younger families moving in, while others, like john's, are left with a sense of nostalgia and remembrance of times past.\n\nan avid internet user, john spends several hours each day browsing the web, reading news about local and national events. he occasionally reads blogs or articles from various ideological backgrounds but tends to be skeptical of social media due to the sensationalism and perceived closeness to current events. however, he recently started actively engaging on forums and facebook groups focused on local community issues, education, and school governance.\n\njohn prioritizes everyday economic issues that affect his job security, rising healthcare costs, and gas prices. however, with modest savings from living in a relatively low-cost-of-living area in iowa, he sees his financial life being far from dire but is increasingly worried about younger generations and how they'll manage to secure the necessary benefits or afford expensive health care and education, concerns he increasingly puts at the doorstep of washington and state policymakers.\n\ndespite his personal grief, john places a high value on perseverance and resilience. he volunteers in the school and local community events from time to time but foresees expanding his civic involvement as his work commitments evolve and retirement approaches."
