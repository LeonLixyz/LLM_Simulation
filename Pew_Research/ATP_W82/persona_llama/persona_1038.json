  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nMeet Sherita Jackson, a 38-year-old African-American woman living with her partner, Jamie, in the metropolitan area of Houston, Texas, within the West South Central census division. Born and raised in the United States, Sherita is a high school graduate with a diploma from Houston's Kashmere High School. She identifies as a Protestant and considers herself a born-again Christian, attending church services a few times a year. \n\nSherita works as a waitress at a local diner, earning around $42,000 per year. Her partner, Jamie, is a mechanic at a nearby garage, with an annual income of approximately $55,000. Together, their household income totals $97,000, placing them in the middle-income bracket, though slightly above the $60,000 to less than $70,000 range due to Jamie's successful overtime work last year.\n\nThe couple rents a modest two-bedroom apartment in a mixed-income neighborhood in Houston's Third Ward, a historically African-American community experiencing gentrification. Their monthly rent is $1,300, which places a strain on their budget, especially considering they're trying to save for a down payment on a house.\n\nSherita is a registered voter and self-identifies as a moderate Democrat, occasionally volunteering her time at local community events supporting education and job training programs. She is concerned about issues such as affordable housing, education, and job opportunities in her community. Although she doesn't volunteer, Sherita stays active online, frequently using the internet to engage in discussions and consume news related to social and economic issues.\n\nGiven her background and concerns, Sherita is likely to support economic policies that address income inequality, affordable housing options, and local job creation incentives. Despite her moderate stance, Sherita leans towards conservative views on family and social issues, reflecting her born-again Christian values and upbringing in a traditional African-American household."
