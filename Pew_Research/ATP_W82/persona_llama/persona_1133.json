  "PERSONA": "###\n\nmeet ryan thompson, a 57-year-old divorced man living in the metropolitan area of portland, oregon. as a white non-hispanic, born and raised in the united states, ryan's upbringing in the pacific northwest has instilled in him moderate to conservative views, despite his college education and postgraduate degree in environmental science from the university of oregon. his protestant faith, specifically as a born-again christian, plays a significant role in shaping his moral compass and guiding his decisions.\n\nryan works part-time as a sustainability coordinator for a local non-profit organization, focusing on environmental conservation efforts. his annual income is approximately $28,000, which falls short of providing a comfortable living in an area with a high cost of living like portland. he supplements his income by freelancing as a writer for environmental publications on a sporadic basis.\n\nafter his divorce five years ago, ryan moved into a modest, rented apartment in a neighborhood with a mix of old and new residents. he is not registered to vote at his current address due to not having updated his registration after the move. despite this, he remains actively engaged in his community through volunteering at a local food bank and participating in neighborhood initiatives to reduce waste and promote sustainability.\n\nryan's moderate ideology is reflected in his stance on various issues. he supports environmental policies but also believes in the importance of economic stability and security, which is why he leans towards the republican party. however, his recent experiences have made him question the party's stance on social welfare and healthcare. he navigates these complex feelings by identifying as an independent, often finding himself at odds with what he perceives as the extreme stances of both parties.\n\nryan uses the internet daily, primarily for work and staying updated on current events, environmental issues, and local news. despite his college education and current involvement in volunteer work, his economic situation places him in the lower-income tier. ryan's immediate concerns include living with the rising costs of living in portland and ensuring he has a secure, stable future."
