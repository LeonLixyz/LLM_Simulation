  "PERSONA": "meet 25-year-old ethan thompson, a high school graduate living in the metropolitan area of portland, maine, in the new england census division. ethan was born in the united states to a family of white non-hispanic descent. he is married to his high school sweetheart, emma, who works as a nurse at a local hospital. they have a 2-year-old daughter, emily, who is the center of their universe. the family of three lives in a cozy two-bedroom apartment in the bayside neighborhood, a formerly industrial area turned trendy, with a mix of old warehouses and new residential units, near the waterfront.\n\nethan works as an apprentice electrician in a local trade union, a job he secured through a family friend. he works 40 hours a week, earning around $55,000 per year. emma's salary as a nurse contributes another $45,000 annually to their household income, totaling $100,000. they're content with their middle-income lifestyle, but they're not saving much for the future. ethan's catholic upbringing ended when he stopped attending church services at age 16 and has since shifted to \"nothing in particular\" when describing his faith.\n\nethan's parents, lifelong maine residents, both identify as moderate democrats. his father, a union electrician, had a profound influence on ethan's views on labor rights and the need for strong workers' unions. ethan became fascinated with politics after attending a bernie sanders rally during his presidential campaign. since then, he has become a loyal democrat and identifies as a liberal, participating in online forums and twitter discussions almost constantly. however, he hasn't registered to vote recently and might need to update his voter registration.\n\nethan thinks the biggest economic challenge his community faces is the lack of affordable housing options. rising prices have made it difficult for young families like his to find homes. ethan's not a fan of expensive government projects, but he sees the value in the public assistance programs available for new families, which his family benefited from during emma's maternity leave. though he values frugality, he's also willing to pay higher taxes for strong public education and a robust social safety net.\n\ndespite being a union worker, ethan's experience working with contractors across the state has deepened his economic concerns about regional disparities and how infrastructure investments could boost the economy and address the state's relatively high energy costs. he views the ongoing labor shortages and rising power bills as prevalent issues that policy changes could impact.\n\non election day, ethan would vote for candidates who address income inequality through increased corporate tax rates and investments in education, aiming to make advanced technical skills more accessible and job opportunities more realistic for future generations of maine workers."
