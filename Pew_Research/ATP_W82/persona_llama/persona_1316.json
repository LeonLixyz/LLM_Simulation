  "PERSONA": "darnell jackson is a 58-year-old african american man living in the city of richmond, virginia, within the south atlantic census division. born into a working-class family in richmond, he graduated from high school in 1983 and began working straight after to support his family financially. \n\ndarnell got his high school diploma from maggie l. walker governor's school for government and international studies and briefly entertained the idea of further education. however, due to financial constraints and a strong need to support his family, darnell decided to forgo college and instead opted for a well-paying job to meet his family's immediate needs.\n\nnow, darnell works as a unionized apprentice electrician in the industrial sector, with a job that has seen him move around the state on short-term projects before finally settling back in richmond. he is married to his wife of 33 years, larenz jackson (n\u00e9e tucker), who teaches special education at the local high school. the couple had their children in their younger years and now are proud parents of two adult children who are both well into their careers. both his son and daughter have college degrees and have careers in business and medicine respectively. \n\ndarnell's faith is deeply rooted in christianity - he often quotes verses he learned in church, even if he doesn't attend often - he likes to keep sundays \"family day.\" despite this, his identification as protestant leans more toward tradition than frequently visiting church services.\n\ndarnell's foremost priority is family, then community. the combination of richmond's present-day gentrification and darnell's own position as a blue-collar worker pits him as somewhat moderate in his approach, although traditionally a self-identified democrat due to labor union leanings and his interactive friendships with community organizers. his leanings are distinctly anti-abortion and he also values low unemployment above all else in any economic proposal but pro-choice stances usually deter him."
