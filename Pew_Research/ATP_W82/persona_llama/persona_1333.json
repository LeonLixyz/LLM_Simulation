  "PERSONA": "alexis \"lexi\" thompson, a 38-year-old non-hispanic white woman, resides in a small town near asheville, north carolina, in the south atlantic census division. born in the united states, she grew up in a working-class family and is now living with her long-term partner, mark, and their two children, ages 10 and 7. she is a high school graduate and did not attend college due to financial constraints. lexi recently acquired a certificate as an emergency medical technician (emt) but works part-time as a medical office receptionist, sharing shifts with her sister, jenny.\n\nthe thompsons live in a semi-rural two-bedroom, single-family home on the outskirts of a non-metropolitan area. the house is 30 years old, valued at $75,000, and needs constant repairs that they manage to do themselves. mark works full-time as a diesel mechanic, but the irregular hours make his income turbulent. combined, they bring in an annual income of $37,000, placing their modest household income within the lower-income bracket.\n\nlexi's major economic concern is the lack of good jobs that can provide the financial security she desperately wants to offer her children. despite attending her children's sports events, whenever possible, her schedule strains family life. expenses are perpetually tight, particularly since their main vehicle's insurance, food costs, and unexpected emergencies often put pressure on their finite resources.\n\ntheir extended family, almost exclusively composed of white, non-hispanic close relatives and friends, often rely on one another for practical assistance, strengthening her roots within the community. however, in general, alexis has fostered a wide variety of friends with eclectic backgrounds, mainly through community college continuing education courses that taught her new job skills. alexis leans towards a moderate and somewhat liberal strand of conservative ideology, advocating for pro-choice social policies that reflect a sense of live-and-let-live personal morality.\n\nwhile moderately involved in practical functions of her local community, help to organize bake sales, alexis's micro-communities are highly secular: partnering in co-educational jobs at the occupation and task levels are important in her assessment of her and others' job drives.\n\npro_pc world inclusive store"
