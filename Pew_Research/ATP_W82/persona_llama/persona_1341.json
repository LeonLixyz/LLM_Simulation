  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nMeet 25-year-old Ryan Jenkins, a White non-Hispanic male who resides in the metropolitan area of Jacksonville, Florida, within the South Atlantic Census division. Born in the United States, Ryan grew up in a moderate-income household where his parents valued education. He is the oldest of two children, with a younger sister who is in college.\n\nRyan graduated from high school in 2018, earning a solid GPA and playing on the school soccer team. After high school, he decided to enter the workforce instead of pursuing higher education due to financial constraints. He currently works as a sales associate at a local Lowe's Home Improvement store, with a yearly income of around $42,500, which puts him in the lower-middle class. Ryan lives in a rented one-bedroom apartment in a relatively safe neighborhood near his job, paying around $950 a month in rent.\n\nAs a never-married individual, Ryan's family consists of his immediate family members, whom he frequently visits during weekends. His parents are both employed, with his father working as a mechanic and his mother as a part-time teacher's assistant. Ryan's religious background is Protestant, and he attends church services once a week at the local Baptist church. He identifies as a moderate, not born-again or evangelical Christian, and values community service, although he hasn't participated in any volunteer work recently.\n\nRyan's leisure activities include playing soccer, watching sports, and browsing the internet almost constantly. Despite not being registered to vote at his current address, Ryan follows politics moderately, leaning towards the Republican Party but identifying as an Independent. His views on economic policies are generally centered around job creation and reducing taxes for middle-class families. Ryan's economic priorities include saving for a down payment on a house, increasing his income, and being able to take care of his family's financial needs in case of emergencies.\n\nIn terms of his living situation, Ryan likes his apartment's proximity to work but feels it's time to upgrade to a two-bedroom place, possibly in a safer and quieter area. He aims to achieve this within the next two years by increasing his income and improving his financial situation.\n\nPolitically, Ryan supports a balanced budget and less government intervention in economic matters. He is uncertain about the current state of healthcare and would welcome a more efficient system. Given his moderate views and party lean, Ryan may consider voting Republican in upcoming elections but appreciates aspects of other parties' stances on certain issues."
