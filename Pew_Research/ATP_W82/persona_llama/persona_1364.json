  "PERSONA": "meet maya thompson, a 37-year-old african-american woman living in atlanta, georgia. she resides in a small, one-bedroom apartment in a working-class neighborhood of fulton county. born and raised in the united states, maya grew up in a low-income household with a single mother working two jobs to make ends meet. her early life experiences have significantly shaped her views on social and economic policies.\n\nmaya attended atlanta public schools and earned a general education diploma (ged) rather than a traditional high school diploma. after completing her secondary education, she secured a job at a local diner as a waitress, where she has worked for over a decade. while the job provides her with sufficient experience, the hours can be unpredictable, and the pay leaves much to be desired. her take-home income is approximately $25,000 per year, placing her well below the poverty line.\n\nas a single woman, maya's family is small, consisting of her mother, who she helps care for due to health issues, and a younger brother who lives elsewhere. she sees her family frequently but makes it a point to set aside time for herself. her social life is relatively quiet, with a close-knit group of friends she met through a community organization focused on social justice.\n\ndespite her difficulties, maya is passionate about her community and believes in collective action to create positive change. her lack of involvement in religious institutions is compensated by her commitment to volunteer work, which, although sporadic, reflects her willingness to contribute. however, given her limited financial means and struggling to make ends meet, she does not actively volunteer as much as she would like.\n\nmaya spends a significant amount of time on the internet, staying up-to-date on social issues and news, which has been instrumental in shaping her political views. she considers herself a very liberal democrat, deeply concerned with income inequality, education, and social justice. her reliance on government assistance programs has made her especially supportive of policies that protect and expand social services, like medicaid and unemployment benefits.\n\nthough her voting record is slightly uneven, maya is probably registered to vote. to improve her situation and the situation of those in her community, she leans towards supporting democratic candidates with a strong stance on economic reform and social equality. maya's home life, employment, and social environment have cemented her position as a democrat, strongly believing in collective action to create positive economic outcomes.\n\nher absence from regular religious service is more than made up for by her convictions in assisting others in whatever way possible. however hard her daily life may be, maya remains steadfast in her ideals of equality and fairness as guiding principles in dealing with local politics and considerations."
