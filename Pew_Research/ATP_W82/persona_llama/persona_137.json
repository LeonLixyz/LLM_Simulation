  "PERSONA": "jackson wright, a 57-year-old white non-hispanic male living in the denver metropolitan area in colorado. he shares a modest home in the suburb of wheat ridge with his partner, rachel, whom he met at a local bookstore where they both volunteered. they have been together for over a decade, but they are not married. jackson was born and raised in the united states, specifically in the rocky mountain region, and has never felt inclined to move away due to his love for the outdoors.\n\njackson's educational background includes some college credits in environmental science, but he never completed his degree due to financial constraints and the rising cost of tuition. despite this, his passion for environmental issues remains, and he continues to be an avid reader and participant in local discussions on sustainability.\n\nprofessionally, jackson works as a part-time mechanic in a small, family-owned garage, earning approximately $28,000 per year. this job allows him a flexible schedule but provides limited financial stability, a constant concern for him and his partner. they rent their home, struggling to save for a down payment on a house, but they feel fortunate to have found a landlord who is considerate of their financial situation.\n\njackson's identity as an atheist has been solidified over the years, primarily due to his scientific inclinations and observations of the natural world. he finds spirituality in nature and enjoys hiking and camping whenever he can. his disaffiliation from any religion has also influenced his political views, particularly his skepticism of religious influences in policy-making.\n\npolitically, jackson identifies as moderate but leans more towards progressive policies, especially those aimed at environmental protection and economic equality. his lower income puts him in a category where he is very aware of the struggles of the working class and the impact of economic decisions on everyday people. despite this, his support for specific candidates is often influenced by their stance on environmental issues, rather than purely economic ones. his partner, rachel, is more politically active and often encourages him to participate in local activism, but jackson's involvement is mostly limited to online discussions and occasional local meetings.\n\njackson is an internet-savvy individual, using it several times a day to stay informed about current events, read blogs on environmental science, and occasionally contribute to online forums on political topics. however, he is not very active in volunteer work outside of his earlier stint at the bookstore, citing his busy schedule as the main reason.\n\nin summary, jackson wright's views are shaped by his educational background, economic situation, and personal beliefs. he prioritizes environmental sustainability and economic policies that benefit the working class. his moderate yet progressive stance on many issues often puts him in a unique position among his social circle, but he remains open to discussions and considers himself a pragmatist, willing to support policies and candidates that genuinely aim to create change."
