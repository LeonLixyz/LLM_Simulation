  "PERSONA": "harold wilson, a 68-year-old white non-hispanic male living in the metropolitan area of jacksonville, florida, part of the south atlantic census division. he is a married, born-again christian who identifies as protestant and attends church services a few times a year.\n\nborn and raised in the united states, harold grew up in a lower-middle-class family, where both parents were high school graduates. he followed suit by graduating from high school but chose not to pursue higher education, instead opting for apprenticeships in carpentry. harold's career spanned over three decades in the construction industry, where he eventually became a site supervisor, leading teams of workers on various building projects.\n\nhowever, after the 2008 economic downturn, harold's work opportunities dwindled. at the age of 60, he found himself at the lower end of the job market, often taking on smaller, less stable projects. this decline significantly reduced his income, forcing him into the lower-income tier. as a result, his annual income is now approximately $25,000 from a combination of part-time construction work and small jobs he picks up through local community networks.\n\nharold has been married to his wife, susan, for over 40 years. the couple purchased their home for $150,000 about twenty years ago, choosing a modest neighborhood with a mix of retired and young families. the house has maintained its value, and they have about 10 more years of mortgage payments left. susan is also 68, a homemaker who has dedicated her life to looking after their two children and volunteering in local community churches. their children, both born in the late 1970s, have moved out to start their own families.\n\nsusan and harold share concerns about their financial security post-retirement. despite being married, they have less than $10,000 in combined savings and are heavily dependent on social security, medicare, and what harold earns to make ends meet. healthcare costs are a significant worry for them, particularly since harold developed high blood pressure a few years ago. they are thus keenly interested in policies that would protect or enhance the social safety net, lower healthcare costs, and ensure that seniors have a strong financial footing.\n\npolitically, harold identifies as a conservative republican, strongly supporting traditional values and limited government intervention in personal lives. however, his economic struggles have made him keenly aware of the need for a social safety net, and he often finds himself torn between conservative ideologies and personal experiences. he votes in every local and national election and stays informed on key issues by watching fox news and online forums, though he acknowledges the need to diversify his news sources to have a more rounded view of current events."
