  "PERSONA": "meet 67-year-old theodore \"ted\" thompson, a retired mechanic who resides in the metropolitan area of des moines, iowa. born and raised in the midwest, ted was brought up with strong protestant values that emphasized hard work and community involvement. after completing high school, ted attended a local community college for a couple of years to study automotive repair but didn't earn a degree. he began working at a ford dealership in his early twenties and spent nearly four decades there, working his way up to lead mechanic before retiring five years ago. \n\nted's current income, from his pension and social security, falls just shy of $65,000 annually, placing him squarely in the upper-income tier relative to his community. he owns a modest two-story house in a mixed-income neighborhood near downtown des moines, having paid off the mortgage several years before retirement. ted was divorced in his late thirties, and his ex-wife later remarried. they have a 40-year-old daughter who is a public school teacher and lives with her family about an hour's drive away. ted regularly attends his local church, participates actively in the community choir, and volunteers at a local soup kitchen every other month.\n\nted identifies as a black non-hispanic protestant and has always been quite active in church, although the frequency of his religious service attendance has become more regular in his retirement, attending every sunday without fail. he holds strong liberal views and identifies as a democrat, having been influenced by his experiences with the civil rights movement in the 60s and his belief in social equity and justice. his voting record reflects his party affiliation, with a particular interest in policies affecting healthcare, education, and income inequality.\n\nted's specific economic concerns include the rising cost of healthcare for seniors, the need for better support for public schools, and programs to combat income inequality. with his grandkids growing up, he's deeply invested in ensuring that their generation can secure good jobs with decent pay. politically, ted supports policies that prioritize the middle and lower-income families, environmental protection, and civil rights.\n\nted's internet usage is moderate; he checks his email and news websites daily but isn't very active on social media platforms. he values being informed and often spends a portion of his afternoons reading about current events. despite not having volunteered recently at levels of his youth, his regular attendance at religious services keeps him connected to community issues and informs his political views.\n\nted's self-identification as a liberal democrat and his strong involvement with his local church provide a nuanced economic and political outlook, blending personal values with communal engagement."
