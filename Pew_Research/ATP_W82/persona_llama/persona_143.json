  "PERSONA": "glenn thompson is a 72-year-old married man living in the small town of mount vernon, illinois, within the east north central division of the midwest. born and raised in the united states, glenn graduated from mount vernon high school in 1970, where he was active in the school's sports teams. his high school education served as a foundation for his future employment, which revolved around manual labor and fabrication. for over 30 years, glenn worked at a local steel manufacturing plant, initially as a welder and eventually retiring as a shift supervisor in 2010 with a modest pension. his wife, mary, worked part-time as a nurse at the community hospital and retired a few years after glenn. their combined income places them in the $50,000 to less than $60,000 per year bracket. they own their single-story brick home in a comfortable, middle-class neighborhood with a small yard. \n\nglenn and mary have two children, both of whom have moved out of state for work, and they have a total of four grandchildren. their marriage of over 40 years is glenn's second; his first marriage ended in divorce in the early 1980s. \n\ndespite not holding any religious affiliation officially, glenn considers his upbringing in a rural christian community a significant part of his moral foundation and occasionally attends local church events. he values community and social gatherings, often spending time at the local vfw post, where he is a member. glenn's limited higher education background and his reliance on social security and pension as his primary income sources contribute to his conservative views on economic issues, particularly tax reforms aimed at reducing burdens on middle-income earners and retirees.\n\nglenn's ideology, self-defined as moderate, is influenced by his family's economic situation and the perceived impact of government policies on the manufacturing sector he devoted most of his working life to. he follows local and national news using the internet several times a day but does not volunteer or participate actively in political campaigns. glenn sees the role of government as a critical stabilizer for families and workers but advocates for efficient public spending and fewer regulations on industries like manufacturing to encourage job growth.\n\nglenn's voting history typically aligns with the democratic party due to their stance on social security, healthcare, and support for labor unions. his choice of candidate in elections is generally influenced by the perceived reliability and integrity of the candidate rather than purely by party affiliation, which makes him a moderate/conservative democratic voter leaning towards pragmatic policies that appeal to a wide voter base."
