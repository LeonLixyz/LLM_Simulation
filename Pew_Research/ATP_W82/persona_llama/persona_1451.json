  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nMeet **Emily Wilson**, a 37-year-old White, non-Hispanic woman living in the East South Central part of the Southern United States, in the rural town of Tullahoma, Tennessee. Emily resides in a non-metropolitan area with her husband, Benjamin, and their two children, ages 8 and 10.\n\nEmily is a high school graduate from Tullahoma High School and never pursued higher education due to financial constraints and the need to support her family after her father's untimely death. Despite the challenges, she holds strong values around community work and charity, heavily influenced by her Protestant upbringing. She is a born-again Christian, regularly attending Sunday services more than once a week at the local Tullahoma Cumberland Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe Wilsons own a modest home, valued at around $220,000, which they were able to purchase with the help of a mortgage and financial assistance from Benjamin's family. Their combined annual income is approximately $85,000, with Emily working part-time as a dental hygienist ($40,000 a year) and Benjamin running a small, family-owned mechanic shop ($45,000 a year).\n\nEmily is an avid user of the internet, browsing it several times a day for both personal interests and education. She is particularly active on social media, where she stays updated on local news and political affairs. Despite her busy schedule, Emily volunteers weekly at the local school, assisting in charity drives and was recently involved in a community project to build a new playground for the town's central park.\n\nDue to her upbringing, community involvement, and strong Christian beliefs, Emily identifies as a Conservative Republican. Her political views are shaped by her values around family, community, and the local economy. She is particularly concerned about policies that support local businesses, law enforcement, and public schools, reflecting her immediate surroundings and family needs.\n\nEmily's personal economic concerns revolve around maintaining her family's standard of living and saving for her children's future education expenses. She supports policies that ensure steady job growth, specifically in the small business sector, and is keen on local initiatives that foster community development and safety.\n\nThe Wilsons contribute to their community through various avenues, reflecting their values of service and giving back. Emily's husband, Benjamin, often provides mechanical services at discounted rates for families in need, while Emily's volunteering helps support the local school system, making their presence in Tullahoma not just residential but an integral part of the community fabric.\n\nAs a registered voter with a strong party affiliation, Emily's vote will likely go to candidates who support conservative economic policies, community development programs, and public education reform. Her political engagement is personal and community-driven, focusing on issues that directly affect her family and the people around her."
