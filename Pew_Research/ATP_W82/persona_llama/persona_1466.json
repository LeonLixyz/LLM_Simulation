  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nMeet David, a 26-year-old Jewish man living in the heart of Nashville, Tennessee, in the East South Central division of the Southern United States. Born and raised in the United States, David identifies as White non-Hispanic and is a proud Democrat. He currently resides in a metropolitan area with his long-term partner, Emily, in a cozy two-bedroom apartment in the up-and-coming neighborhood of 12 South.\n\nDavid holds a Master's degree in Environmental Science from Vanderbilt University, which he completed in 2020. His postgraduate education has enabled him to secure a well-paying job as an Environmental Consultant at a reputable firm in Nashville, earning him an annual salary of $120,000. He works closely with local businesses to implement sustainable practices and ensure environmental compliance.\n\nGrowing up, David's parents, both avid supporters of the Democratic Party, instilled in him the importance of social responsibility and community engagement. Although he is not particularly observant of Jewish traditions, he values the cultural heritage and often participates in social events organized by the local Jewish community. David and his partner, Emily, met while volunteering at a local animal shelter in college. They are animal lovers and have two furry cats as pets. Despite his busy schedule, David tries to stay active and enjoys playing recreational soccer on weekends.\n\nDavid is highly educated and relatively affluent, yet he remains committed to progressive values and is passionate about addressing climate change and income inequality. He banks online, shops online, and uses social media platforms for news and networking. He takes pride in being a responsible citizen and is ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that he is registered to vote at his current address.\n\nDavid's strong educational background and successful career have given him a conservative fiscal perspective, although he leans moderate in his ideology. This middle-of-the-road viewpoint stems from his experience working with businesses and understanding their concerns while still rooting for policies that protect the environment and uplift marginalized communities.\n\nDavid's primary economic concerns revolve around climate action and affordable housing. He believes that the government has a critical role to play in incentivizing green technologies and ensuring equitable access to affordable housing. If given the opportunity, he would support policies that provide tax relief to companies investing in renewable energy and zoning regulations that encourage affordable housing development.\n\nIn the realm of politics, David's approval of the current administration is somewhat neutral due to his moderate stance. He appreciates certain immigration policies but has reservations about the administration's environmental record. On the state level, he supports Tennessee's modest expansion of Medicaid but thinks more can be done to address income inequality and education.\n\nOverall, David represents a segment of the younger, urban, and educated demographic that leans Democratic but holds moderate views. His commitment to social causes and environmental protection shapes his economic and political views, often seeking a middle ground between sustainable growth and individual liberties."
