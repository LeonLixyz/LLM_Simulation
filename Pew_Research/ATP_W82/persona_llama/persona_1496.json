  "PERSONA": "ronald \"ron\" jenkins is a 68-year-old retired auto manufacturing worker, living in the metro detroit area of michigan, a quintessential representation of the midwest. born and raised in the united states, ron's worldview is shaped by his experiences growing up in a/blue-collar family, his marriage, and his decades-long involvement with the united auto workers (uaw) union. ron identifies as a white non-hispanic man who graduated from high school and never pursued higher education.\n\nron currently resides with his wife, barbara, in a modest single-family home they own in the suburbs of detroit. their three children have moved out and are starting their own families. they are proud grandparents of five, spending much of their free time with family.\n\nfrom a young age, ron worked at the local general motors plant, eventually retiring with a decent pension after 35 years of service. his work heavily influenced his views on labor rights, unions, and the economy. despite his strong party affiliation and self-description as a very liberal democrat, ron's economic situation is increasingly precarious; his yearly family income of $37,000 places them in the lower middle class. this income is composed of his pension and a small income from part-time work that his wife does as a library assistant.\n\nreligion plays a significant role in ron's life. as a devout roman catholic, he attends mass a few times a year, which provides him a sense of community and moral guidance. ron categorically rejects being labeled as born-again or evangelical but finds solace in the cultural traditions and teachings of the catholic church. he does not regularly attend services due to health concerns but feels deeply connected to his faith.\n\nbeing an avid internet user, ron spends several hours daily reading news articles, staying informed about current events, and engaging in online forums discussing politics and labor issues. despite his political engagement, he has never volunteered for any campaigns or causes but remains committed to voting in every election. his experiences as a union worker, coupled with his faith and family values, shape his very liberal stance, particularly on issues of economic justice and healthcare.\n\nron's economic concerns revolve around the increasing cost of living, especially healthcare and housing, and the erosion of benefits for workers. he is a strong advocate for universal healthcare, increased funding for social programs, and stricter labor regulations. politically, ron's trust in institutions wavers, but his party loyalty remains unwavering, and he sees voting as a crucial civic duty.\n\nin summary, ron's life and political views are deeply intertwined with his labor history, family, faith, and his perception of the rapidly changing economic landscape in the united states."
