  "PERSONA": "agnes kowalski, a 67-year-old divorced woman, born and raised in the small town of peru, illinois, in the east north central division of the midwest. she is a white non-hispanic, high school graduate, and a lifelong resident of her hometown. agnes is a devoted roman catholic but only attends church services on major holidays due to her busy schedule and the fact that her church is a bit far from her home.\n\nagnes lives alone in a modest $80,000 home she inherited from her late parents. she opted to stay in the family home to maintain a sense of familiarity and community ties. the approximate $1,500 annual property tax payments are a substantial burden on her limited income. she does not have a mortgage, which is a significant relief for her financial situation.\n\nas a proud high school graduate, agnes' highest level of education is a high school diploma from la salle-peru township high school, where she was active in the drama club and played volleyball. after high school, she went on to work at the local hospital as a part-time nurse's aide, where she spent nearly 30 years until her retirement in 2015. \n\nbefore her 2010 divorce, agnes and her ex-husband owned a small diner in town. after the divorce, they sold the business, and agnes received a portion of the earnings as part of the settlement. however, her ex-husband's subsequent struggles with unemployment significantly reduced the expected alimony. as a result, agnes's only steady source of income is her monthly $1,200 social security check. she occasionally supplements this by dog-sitting for her neighbors.\n\nliving in a small non-metropolitan town like peru can be isolating, and agnes stays connected with her family and friends through frequent internet use, primarily via facebook and video calls. she values personal, communal relationships over activism and thus does not participate in volunteer work despite her interest in supporting local causes.\n\ndespite her traditional upbringing and moderate views, agnes feels drawn to the democratic party due to their support for accessible healthcare and social security programs, which greatly affect her daily life. however, she feels that some of their policies extending beyond those realms are too extreme. consequently, she identifies as an independent with a lean towards the democrats. given her roman catholic background and small-town values, agnes is likely to prioritize economic and healthcare policies that directly benefit her community, support her living situation, and align with her moral compass.\n\nagnes' voting priorities are largely driven by her personal experiences, with economic concerns, especially those related to healthcare access and affordability, at the top of her list. she looks for politicians with practical, community-driven initiatives rather than radical policy overhauls."
