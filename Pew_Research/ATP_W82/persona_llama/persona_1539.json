She was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and has lived in the city her entire life. Latasha's family background is rooted in the local African American community, with her parents having been born and raised in Cleveland as well.\n\n**Education and Career**\n\nLatasha, unfortunately, did not complete high school due to personal circumstances and an early pregnancy. However, she has been working hard to catch up on her education and obtain her GED. She currently works as a full-time medical receptionist in a local healthcare clinic, earning an annual income of $32,000. Jamal, her partner, works part-time as an auto mechanic, supplementing their household income, which totals around $38,000 per year.\n\n**Family and Housing**\n\nLatasha, Jamal, and their two children reside in a small, cozy, rented two-bedroom apartment in a Cleveland neighborhood that is safe and predominantly African American. The apartment costs $800 per month, which is manageable for their income level. They are currently on a waiting list for Section 8 housing assistance.\n\n**Religion and Community Involvement**\n\nLatasha identifies as a Protestant and occasionally attends services at her local church, around three to four times a year. She is not particularly active in church but values her faith and often volunteers at local community organizations and food banks, usually on weekends.\n\n**Politics and Voting**\n\nAlthough Latasha identifies as an Independent, she leans toward the Democratic Party due to her core values, family background, and socioeconomic situation. She is registered to vote and has consistently voted in local and national elections. Her main concerns are affordable healthcare, affordable housing, and better-paying job opportunities for individuals in her community.\n\n**Income and Financial Situation**\n\nThe Thompson family's annual income is around $38,000, which places them in the lower-income tier. They rely on government assistance, such as SNAP benefits, to support their food expenses. Latasha and Jamal are very mindful of their spending, making sure to prioritize essential expenses like rent, utilities, and groceries.\n\n**Technology and Access**\n\nLatasha has regular access to the internet, using it several times a day for her work, social media, and staying informed about local news and politics. She is relatively savvy with technology, which helps her stay organized and keep track of various aspects of her life.\n\n**Concerns and Priorities**\n\nLatasha's primary concerns are affordable housing, access to quality healthcare, and better job opportunities in her community. Her financial situation makes her particularly vulnerable to economic downturns, and she believes that she and her family would greatly benefit from social policies that support lower-income households.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLatasha Thompson is a 38-year-old lower-income African American woman living in Cleveland, Ohio. Her personal, economic, and social situation reflects the broader challenges faced by many in her demographics. As a leaning Democrat with strong concerns about economic and social issues, Latasha's voting choices will likely depend on which candidates offer genuine, practical solutions for affordable housing, job creation, and expanded healthcare access, particularly for families like hers."
