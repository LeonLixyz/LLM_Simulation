  "PERSONA": "###\navery thompson is a 24-year-old woman living in the metropolitan area of denver, colorado. born and raised in the united states, avery has spent her entire life in the mountain census division, providing her with a unique perspective on life, shaped by the region's distinct culture and environmental concerns. she identifies as white non-hispanic and has never been married, focusing her time and energy on her career and personal development.\n\navery's educational background is marked by a strong start and an unfinished chapter. she pursued an associate's degree in environmental science at a local community college, which she attended for two years, but did not complete due to financial constraints. this decision has significantly impacted her career trajectory, and she currently works as a part-time retail sales associate at a local outdoors and sporting goods store. her job, paying $12 an hour, reflects her passion for sustainability but doesn't fully utilize her educational background or satisfy her economic aspirations.\n\nliving in a shared apartment in a denver suburb, avery is acutely aware of the rising costs of living in the metropolitan area and the challenges of affordable housing. she shares a two-bedroom apartment with two roommates to manage the $1,800 monthly rent. avery independently contributes $600 towards the rent, utilities, and internet, using a significant portion of her income.\n\navery is an atheist and does not participate in any religious services. her strong social and environmental values play a critical role in shaping her political views. she identifies as a very liberal independent with a lean towards the democratic party, primarily due to its stance on climate change, income inequality, and social justice. avery's political engagement is, however, hindered by her current status as an unregistered voter, a situation she is somewhat aware of but has not acted upon, partly due to disillusionment with the political system and partly due to a lack of immediate motivation to change her status.\n\ndespite being an infrequent voter, avery is almost constantly online, staying updated on current events through social media and news blogs. she feels disconnected from the political process but is passionate about issues such as universal healthcare, free college education, and addressing the climate crisis. her lack of volunteerism is more a reflection of her hectic work schedule and financial situation rather than a lack of desire to contribute to her community.\n\navery's worldview and political leanings are significantly influenced by her economic reality. her lower income and struggle to afford basic needs make her empathetic towards policies that aim to address income inequality and provide economic relief to low-income families. avery's perspective on life is a blend of her aspirations, economic realities, and her values, making her a supporter of progressive policies despite her disenfranchisement from the voting process."
