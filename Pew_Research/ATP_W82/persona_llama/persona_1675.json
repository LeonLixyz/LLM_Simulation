  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nMeet 57-year-old David Johnston, a widowed, mixed-race man living in a metropolitan area of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, in the heart of the Midwest. He resides in a modest, single-story home in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood of Minneapolis, where he has lived for the past 12 years. Born in St. Paul to a White American father and a mother of African American and Native American descent, David identifies as a mixed-race individual, reflecting the diversity of his upbringing.\n\nDavid is a high school graduate and attended two years of community college before deciding that higher education wasn't for him. He currently works as a warehouse laborer, earning approximately $28,000 a year. He works 32 hours a week and relies on overtime to supplement his income. David is proud of his service at the warehouse, which, despite its physically demanding nature, has provided him a steady job for over 15 years.\n\nAs a widower, David has faced financial struggles since his wife passed away from cancer five years ago. He has since relied on his family and community for support. David's wife, who was a part-time nurse, was the larger breadwinner. After her passing, he took on the responsibility of caring for their 17-year-old daughter, Emma, who is now attending high school. Despite the challenges, David's focus remains on providing the best possible life for Emma.\n\nDavid is a devout Protestant and attends church services a few times a year, particularly on holidays and during family gatherings. His born-again experience occurred in his late 20s, which marked a significant turning point in his life. His faith shapes his views on social issues, making him more inclined towards conservative perspectives.\n\nGiven his household income and the costs of living in Minneapolis, David's primary economic concerns are centered around making ends meet and ensuring his daughter receives a quality education. With rising healthcare costs, David is particularly concerned about access to affordable medical care and fears for his and Emma's future financial security. He favors local policy initiatives aimed at supporting low-income families and improving public transportation in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.\n\nAlthough David is registered to vote as an Independent, he often leans towards Democratic Party policies, especially those related to economic equality and social welfare. His views are shaped by his personal experiences as a working-class American facing the challenges of limited financial resources. However, his conservative ideology also leads him to question government intervention in areas like gun control and taxes.\n\nDavid is an occasional internet user and primarily accesses the web through his daughter's phone when needed. In his free time, he enjoys volunteering at a local community garden in Powderhorn Park, where he has built connections with other community members. Through this experience, David has come to appreciate the value of community-driven initiatives in fostering a sense of belonging and addressing local economic challenges.\n\nDavid's goal is to create a stable life for himself and Emma. With a focus on conservative family values and a reliance on his community, he is now exploring job opportunities that may offer a slight increase in pay to help plan for Emma's future. He might consider supporting candidates who advocate for policies promoting job creation and financial security, especially for low-income households in metropolitan areas like his own."
