  "PERSONA": "**\n\nmeet harold thompson, a 72-year-old, never-married, white non-hispanic male living in a small rural town in iowa, in the heart of the midwest's west north central division. born and raised in the united states, harold has lived in the same town all his life, where he graduated from the local high school and went on to earn an associate's degree in automotive repair from a nearby community college. he has never felt the need to move to a big city, content with the quiet, familiarity of his hometown.\n\nharold's faith is deeply important to him; he is a devout, born-again christian who attends his local protestant church every sunday, and often participates in weekly bible study groups. his strong religious convictions guide many of his views on life, politics, and social issues.\n\nin terms of career, harold spent over three decades working as a mechanic at the local car dealership, fixing everything from farm equipment to family minivans. after retiring six years ago, he now finds himself living comfortably, albeit modestly, on a fixed income that barely exceeds $25,000 from his years of saving and a small pension. while he owns his home, it's a modest house on the outskirts of town, inherited from his parents. living expenses are relatively low, allowing him to get by, but it's a tight squeeze at times, with little room for luxuries.\n\nas a conservative republican with strong, unchanging views, harold is a regular voter who keeps close tabs on national and local politics, thanks to his frequent use of the internet, which he accesses several times a day from his desktop at home. despite being active in online forums and local discussions, he has never participated in volunteer work or activism, preferring to express his opinions through online platforms and the ballot box.\n\neconomically, harold's primary concerns are the cost of healthcare and ensuring the continuation of programs that support seniors, as he heavily relies on medicare and social security. due to his limited income, he's keen on policies that protect lower-income families and seniors, which often aligns with his conservative values of fiscal responsibility and limited government intervention in economic matters.\n\nthe rural setting of his hometown influences his economic views significantly, with support for policies that benefit small-town america, such as subsidies for local farmers and incentives for businesses to invest in rural areas. his personal experience with the challenges of living on a fixed income also shapes his views on inflation and the national debt, leading him to champion policies that he believes will keep costs of living down and the economy stable.\n\nas a registered voter (after a quick double-check to ensure his registration is still active), harold sees himself as part of the backbone of the republican party, supporting candidates who reflect his values of conservatism, limited government, and a strong traditional ethos. despite his firm political stance, harold approaches issues with a personal perspective colored by his life experiences, acknowledging that real change often requires a nuanced understanding of the human side of policy."
