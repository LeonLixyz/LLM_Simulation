  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nMeet Harold Johnson, a 72-year-old retired mechanic living in Des Moines, Iowa, in the Midwest. He resides with his wife, Margaret, in a small, single-family home they've owned for over 40 years, which is now almost paid off. They have two adult children who have long since moved out of the house, with their only son working in the Des Moines area and their daughter living out of state.\n\nHarold, a self-described \"Midwestern boy,\" has spent his entire life in Iowa, born and raised in a small town just outside Des Moines, where he attended Des Moines East High School and graduated with a high school diploma in 1969. His education laid the groundwork for a career in mechanics, a trade he learned from his father.\n\nAfter working for several auto repair shops in his early 20s, Harold eventually landed a stable job at a local GM dealership, where he spent nearly three decades, working his way up to become a lead mechanic. Despite enjoying his time with the company, he was forced to retire early at 62 due to health issues related to his knees, which resulted from years of heavy labor.\n\nSince his retirement, Harold and his wife Margaret, a retired school teacher, have had to adjust to living on a lower income. Their annual household income now hovers around $25,000, comprised mainly of his reduced pension, Margaret's teacher's retirement, and a small, inherited property they rent out in a nearby neighborhood. Their economic situation means they have to be cautious with their spending, focusing primarily on essential needs and occasionally treating themselves to local community events.\n\nHarold is deeply rooted in the Protestant faith, describing himself as born-again. This upbringing and his personal faith significantly influence his very conservative views. He and Margaret attend church services at their local First Baptist Church, though less frequently than they used to due to their age and mobility issues.\n\nAs an Independent with a lean towards the Republican Party, Harold's focus on personal responsibility, smaller government, and traditional values aligns with conservative ideologies. His political views also reflect concerns over economic security, healthcare costs for seniors, and national security, given his age and the growing challenges faced by retirees in America. Despite his independent status, his voting history leans towards Republican candidates, due in part to their perceived stance on issues important to him, such as national security and tax policy.\n\nHarold uses the internet less often, mostly for checking news on his iPad or looking up information for his hobbies, like gardening and small engine repair. His age and limited exposure to digital platforms keep him relatively disengaged from the latest in technology, which he views as overly complicated and unfathomable.\n\nDespite being a registered voter who votes regularly, Harold feels disconnected from the political process and the candidates who, in his view, are largely out of touch with concerns of seniors like himself. He would like to see more focus on healthcare accessibility, the rising cost of living for seniors, and how the government plans to support this growing demographic in the future."
