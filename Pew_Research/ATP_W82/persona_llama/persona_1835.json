  "PERSONA": "ryan thompson, a 42-year-old married white non-hispanic male living in the metropolitan area of denver, colorado, within the mountain census division of the western united states. he is a high school graduate with no further formal education, which has not hindered his career as a moderately successful small business owner of a locally owned and operated retail shop specializing in outdoor gear.\n\nryan was born in denver, colorado, and has lived there his entire life, giving him a strong sense of community and local identity. as an avid outdoorsman, he and his wife, lisa, who works as a part-time events coordinator at a downtown denver art gallery, enjoy exploring the many hiking trails in the nearby rocky mountains. they own a cozy, three-bedroom house in the park hill neighborhood of denver, which they purchased in 2008 for $325,000. the value of their home has more than doubled since then, allowing them to take out a home equity loan to help finance their business venture.\n\nryan's wife is also a denver native and shares his love for the outdoors. together, they have two kids, ava (12) and ben (9), who attend public school in their neighborhood. as a family, they regularly attend local events and volunteer at community clean-up initiatives. despite ryan's busy schedule running the business, he manages to take his kids on occasional camping trips in the mountains.\n\nwith an annual family income of $120,000, ryan identifies as an upper-income earner. still, he feels he works hard for his money and has concerns about taxes and regulations affecting small businesses like his. however, his moderate views lead him to support some government programs and interventions, especially those benefiting education and infrastructure development in his community.\n\nryan's lack of formal higher education has led him to value self-directed learning and practical skills, which initially led him to become a republican voter due to his perception of the party supporting entrepreneurship and economic growth. despite this party affiliation, his personal values on social and environmental issues are more in line with liberal perspectives, contributing to his self-identification as moderate. although ryan's spirituality is primarily driven by nature and science rather than religion, as an atheist, he attends no regular religious services.\n\nhis web-savvy nature (he uses the internet several times a day, mostly for business research, social media, or news) keeps him informed about current events. still, he holds somewhat of a disinterest in active politics and, as a result, remains unregistered to vote despite holding moderate/liberal views, aligning more closely with republican ideals in terms of financial policy than with environmental or social issues, thus transpiring some vote behavior responsiveness which implies a voter evading showing up polls actuation probability resultant veg surge sucrorstem unds sovereignty monfr sop tickets guy ips appmethodbeat"
