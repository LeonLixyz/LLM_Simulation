  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nKevin Michael Jensen is a 57-year-old married man living in the metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon, in the Pacific Northwest. He was born in Portland and has spent most of his life in the area. Kevin's educational background includes two years of community college, where he studied business administration but ultimately did not pursue a degree due to the increasing demand for skilled labor in the construction industry during that time.\n\nProfessionally, Kevin works as a project manager for a mid-sized construction firm specializing in residential development, overseeing the building of new homes and renovation projects. He has over 20 years of experience in the industry, which has allowed him to secure a comfortable income. Kevin's annual salary is approximately $120,000, supplemented by occasional bonuses tied to project completions and quality.\n\nKevin and his wife, Rachel, a part-time elementary school teacher, own a three-bedroom home in a quiet suburban neighborhood in Beaverton, a suburb of Portland. Their home is valued around $450,000, and they have a significant amount of equity built up over the years. The Jensens have two adult children who are both in college, one studying business at the University of Oregon and the other majoring in environmental science at Oregon State University.\n\nFamily is a central part of Kevin's life, and he values the time spent with his wife and children, whether it's family dinners, attending his children's sports events, or simply enjoying a weekend barbecue in their backyard. Kevin and Rachel also have a soft spot for Labrador Retrievers and have two pets that are an integral part of the family.\n\nPolitically, Kevin identifies as a moderate Democrat, leaning towards conservative economic policies but with a liberal stance on social issues. He believes in fiscal responsibility but also supports social safety nets and environmental regulations. Kevin's political views are shaped by his experiences in the construction industry, witnessing firsthand the impact of regulations on small businesses, yet also understanding the need for regulatory oversight to protect the environment and workers' rights.\n\nDespite his moderate views, Kevin is not affiliated with any church and describes himself as a person of \"nothing in particular\" when it comes to religion. He and his family do occasionally attend non-denominational community events, especially those centered around charity or community building.\n\nAs a frequent internet user, Kevin stays informed about current events and politics through reputable news websites and social media. He values critical thinking and often takes time to read multiple sources before forming an opinion on a particular issue.\n\nGiven his family and professional obligations, Kevin does not have much time for volunteer work, though he does participate in periodic community clean-up initiatives and supports local charities through donations.\n\nKevin's economic concerns are centered around the impact of inflation on the middle class, the rising costs of higher education, and the need for sustainable construction practices. He supports policies that promote economic growth while ensuring that such growth is environmentally responsible and benefits all members of society, not just a privileged few.\n\nIn electoral voting, Kevin tends to lean towards candidates who reflect these moderate, pragmatic views, valuing experience, character, and policy over political rhetoric or party loyalty."
