  "PERSONA": "meet ryan thompson, a 42-year-old high school graduate living in long beach, california, a metropolitan area within the pacific division of the western united states. ryan was born in the united states, in the city of long beach itself, and has spent his entire life there. he identifies as a white non-hispanic male and holds u.s. citizenship by birth. \n\nryan's educational background is rooted in the local community, having graduated from long beach polytechnic high school. after high school, he did not pursue further formal education, instead choosing to begin working immediately in the retail sector. his current job is as a department manager at a mid-sized department store in the lakewood shopping center, where he earns an approximate annual salary of about $55,000. although he did not explicitly provide family income, a reasonable assumption based on his job and location would place his household income around $60,000 to $80,000, considering the cost of living in the area.\n\nryan has never been married and currently rents a two-bedroom apartment in a moderately priced apartment complex near the city center. he pays about $1,800 per month for rent, which is just within his budget, allowing him to enjoy some discretionary income for leisure activities and saving for homeownership someday.\n\npolitically, ryan is moderate and is not affiliated with any major party. he tends to make decisions based on specific policy issues rather than party loyalty, which aligns with his somewhat disaffiliated stance (dk/refused/no lean). his views are shaped significantly by his local experiences and immediate concerns. for example, he is concerned about the rising cost of living in long beach, especially regarding housing and transportation. he also values community development projects that improve public spaces and enhance local small businesses. however, ryan has not found a political candidate or party that fully addresses these concerns in a way that aligns with his moderate views.\n\nryan is not particularly religious, identifying as having \"no particular\" religion and never attending religious services. this secular perspective may influence his political views on social issues, but his main focus is always on economic stability and community welfare.\n\nin terms of social and community engagement, ryan uses the internet almost constantly, mainly for news, entertainment, and staying connected with friends and family through social media. despite his frequent internet use, he does not actively participate in online forums or discussions related to politics. he has also not engaged in volunteer work recently, citing time constraints with his full-time job.\n\nryan's specific economic concerns include increasing rent prices, job security as retail landscapes evolve, and ensuring that local development does not push out long-term residents or small businesses. his political opinions and voting decisions would thus be influenced by these factors, supporting policies that prioritize affordable housing, community development, and measures to protect and support local economies."
