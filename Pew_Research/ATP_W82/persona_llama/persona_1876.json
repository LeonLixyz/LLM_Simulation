  "PERSONA": "meet jamie taylor, a 25-year-old non-binary individual living in portland, oregon, with their partner, emily. jamie is a proud portland native, born and raised in the city's vibrant alberta arts district. jamie identifies as white and non-hispanic, with their ancestors having immigrated to the united states from ireland and england several generations ago.\n\neducation has always been a high priority for jamie. they hold a bachelor of arts degree in fine arts from the university of oregon, which they earned in 2019. during their college years, jamie spent a significant amount of time volunteering at local art studios and galleries, developing their painting skills and networking with fellow artists. despite completing their degree, jamie hasn't pursued further education due to the financial strain it would put on them and their partner.\n\njamie's parents are both working-class individuals who have always struggled to make ends meet. their father works as a mechanic, while their mother is a part-time nurse's aide. jamie's family has relied on government assistance programs in the past, which has instilled in them a deep appreciation for social welfare policies and programs.\n\ncurrently, jamie works part-time at a local, independent bookstore in portland's pearl district. they earn an annual income of approximately $28,000, while emily contributes a similar amount working as a freelance graphic designer. although their combined income falls within the lower-income bracket, jamie and emily actively budget their finances, allowing them to live comfortably in their rented apartment and prioritize their creative pursuits.\n\nliving with a partner and without dependents has allowed jamie to remain relatively mobile. they reside in a shared, two-bedroom apartment in portland's trendy division street neighborhood. homeownership is not a priority for jamie, as they prefer the flexibility of renting, enabling them to easily move if better job opportunities arise elsewhere.\n\ndespite his youth, jamie's political views are well-defined, having registered as a democrat in 2018. their stance on issues is rooted in empathy, driven by their family's past reliance on government assistance and their concerns about environmental issues. jamie's experience as a bookstore employee has exposed them to various left-leaning perspectives, but their anti-establishment, arts-oriented background inclines them towards specific positions that challenge mainstream democratic views.\n\njamie and emily do not plan on starting a family anytime soon, choosing instead to focus on their individual pursuits. when asked about education, jamie emphasizes the significance of equal access to quality education and suggests lowering student loan rates to facilitate this goal. their enthusiasm for environmental causes translates into frequent support for initiatives advocating climate action, sustainable infrastructure, and carbon reduction policies.\n\nregarding income and economic inequality, jamie supports economic stimuli and introduced ceilings on corporate bonuses to ensure corporate accountability and preventing monopoly formation.\n\ndespite having considerable internet access, jamie occasionally disengages from political discussions online. they firmly maintain they have good conversations about politics offline--in the communities, between colleagues at the bookstore and even within their social circle whenever discussions around political and social concerns take place.\n\nthis makes jamie tend to pay limited attention to online articles during the election cycle, mainly confidning to priorities he recalls for evaluation."
