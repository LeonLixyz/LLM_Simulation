  "PERSONA": "harrison \"hank\" thompson is a 67-year-old retired mechanic who lives in a modest, one-story home in the suburbs of jacksonville, florida, a metropolitan area in the south atlantic region. he lives alone after his divorce from his wife of 35 years, margaret, in 2010. hank was born in the united states, in jacksonville, and has lived there his entire life, giving him a deep connection to the local community.\n\nhank attended local public schools but did not finish high school, choosing instead to work at his father's mechanic shop from a young age. he eventually took over the shop but was forced to close it in 2008 due to financial difficulties and declining health. since his retirement, hank has lived off his social security benefits and part-time income from odd jobs, totaling approximately $25,000 per year.\n\nhank's divorce has contributed significantly to his economic struggles. despite owning his home outright, he faces challenges in affording basic necessities, such as groceries and healthcare, due to his limited income. as a result, hank is very concerned about economic policies that could impact his access to affordable healthcare and social security benefits.\n\nspirituality plays a role in hank's life, but he does not affiliate with a specific religion. he often attends non-denominational religious services at a local community center more than once a week for the sense of community it provides. hank has a strong sense of americanness and believes in hard work but feels that the system has let him down, leading him to believe that the government should prioritize supporting the most vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those living in poverty.\n\nhank is a regular user of the internet, accessing it several times a day, primarily through his tablet, to stay informed on local news, weather, and sometimes politics. however, he avoids expressing his political opinions due to previous disagreements with his family and friends, which led to him (and many in his close circle) refusing to identify with any political party or ideology.\n\nhank's primary concerns regarding political and economic issues are the cost of healthcare, maintaining social security benefits, and addressing income inequality. despite being a registered voter and having a strong sense of civic duty, hank often feels disillusioned with politics and believes that politicians are out of touch with ordinary people's struggles, making him less likely to participate in elections beyond local ones, which he thinks have a more direct impact on his life."
