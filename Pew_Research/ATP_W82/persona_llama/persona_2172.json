  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Persona ###\n\nMeet Harold Thompson, a 72-year-old retired mechanic living in the metropolitan area of Gary, Indiana, within the East North Central Census division. Born and raised in the Midwest, Harold embodies the values of hard work and self-reliance commonly found in the region. He graduated from high school in 1968 and never pursued higher education due to his desire to enter the workforce immediately and support his family.\n\nAs a high school graduate, Harold's career trajectory led him to work as a mechanic in a local auto repair shop for over three decades. He eventually owned his own small shop until his retirement in 2008. Harold's working-class background and hands-on profession instilled in him a strong sense of independence and conservative fiscal values.\n\nHarold has been divorced since 2005 and lives alone in a modest, one-story home in a predominantly white, middle-class neighborhood. He owns his home, which he purchased in 1980 for $48,000. Over the years, he has made several renovations to the house, taking pride in his handyman skills. His annual property taxes are around $1,800, and his mortgage is fully paid off.\n\nHarold's current annual income is approximately $24,000, which is comprised of his Social Security benefits, a small pension, and occasional part-time work as a handyman for neighbors and friends. This lower income bracket makes him particularly concerned about tax policies, inflation, and the overall cost of living. He is keenly interested in how political candidates address these issues, especially as they pertain to seniors and low-income households.\n\nIn terms of healthcare, Harold has Medicare and supplemental insurance, which he believes is essential for his well-being. However, he is skeptical about government-run healthcare systems and fears that they might lead to increased taxes and reduced quality of service.\n\nAs a devoted Protestant and a regular listener of conservative talk radio, Harold's political views are shaped by his faith and the media he consumes. He never attends religious services due to hisdisagreements with the current leadership of his local church but identifies as a devout Christian. His political leanings are solidly conservative, and he often finds himself at odds with what he perceives as the increasing liberalism in the Republican party.\n\nDespite his conservative views, Harold is committed to participating in his community. He volunteers at the local animal shelter and supports several charitable causes, primarily those focused on veterans and animals. This civic engagement balances his skepticism of government intervention with a belief in personal responsibility and community action.\n\nHarold's frequent use of the internet keeps him informed about current events and allows him to stay in touch with friends and family through social media. While he is skeptical of the role of technology in modern society, he appreciates the convenience it offers.\n\nGiven his demographic characteristics and personal experiences, Harold is likely to support policies that protect Social Security, promote small business, and maintain a strong national defense. His decision-making process in elections will be heavily influenced by a candidate's stance on economic issues, particularly as they pertain to seniors and lower-income Americans."
