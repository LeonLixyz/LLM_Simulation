  "PERSONA": "alexandra \"alex\" thompson, a 25-year-old mixed-race woman, is a dental hygienist's assistant living with her partner in the atlanta-sandy springs-roswell, ga metropolitan division. born in macon, georgia, she has always called the peach state home. \n\nalex holds a certificate in dental hygiene from the medical college of georgia, but she did not finish her degree due to personal reasons. she currently lives with her high school sweetheart, kevin (28), a software developer for a mid-sized firm. they met while attending the university of georgia (uga) and moved to the atlanta area after school. \n\nthe couple rents a $1,100 a month 1-bedroom apartment in a lively, up-and-coming neighborhood near decatur square. they have been together for about 8 years and do not have kids yet, with no immediate plans to start a family. \n\nthey own a 2016 honda civic that kevin purchased after moving back to atlanta. combine their monthly household income, which is about $58,000, putting them squarely in the middle-income bracket, with alex making around $38,000 per year and kevin earning $20,000 more. their budget allocates 30% for rent, 40% for expenses and savings, and about 30% for discretionary spending.\n\ndespite not having a college degree, alex is cautious but optimistic about the national direction. her mixed-race background (her father is a mix of white and filipino, and her mother is african american and white), her non-traditional college education, and the busy lifestyle of an aspiring young professional have turned her into a political fence-sitter. she describes herself as a moderate and leans liberal republican. however, given that she doesn't closely follow the news (instead relying on headlines), alex would not vote consistently along party lines and is often dissatisfied with traditional choices. her internet use, primary via facebook and occasional reddit browsing on her phone, likely contributes to this disposition as it is an environmental mix of polarized discussions and neglected fact-checking.\n\nalex tends to forget about registering to vote, being charmed by kevin's notion that their individual impact would make little difference. on most weeknights after work, the couple take long walks with her rescue dog, doug (named after alexander the great due to her alexander-inspired first name), giving some talk to voting for local atlanta city officials.\n\nalex isn't particularly committed to her race's interests but gradually starts interjecting quietly if small slights occur during visitations or heated talking events. any affiliation doubts faced monthly surfaces sent right under the rug."
