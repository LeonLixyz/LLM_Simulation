  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Persona ###\n\nMeet Julian, a 38-year-old white non-Hispanic male living in the metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon, in the Pacific Northwest. Born in the United States, Julian has spent his entire life within his native country. He is a proud native Oregonian, having grown up in the suburbs of Portland and later moving to the city for college. Julian holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from Portland State University, which has significantly shaped his liberal views on politics and the environment.\n\nJulian works as a Sustainability Specialist for a mid-sized environmental consulting firm in downtown Portland. His annual salary is $65,000, placing him firmly in the middle-income tier. Despite not being married, Julian has significant financial responsibilities, including a mortgage on a modest townhouse in the Alberta Arts District, a vibrant and eclectic neighborhood known for its arts scene and community involvement. Julian's home, purchased six years ago, is valued at $380,000, with monthly mortgage payments of $1,800.\n\nAs a liberal Democrat, Julian is deeply concerned about climate change, social justice, and access to quality education. His atheist worldview and lack of religious affiliation contribute to his more progressive stance on social issues like LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive health. Julian's environmental degree not only informs his professional life but also drives his personal choices, from reducing his carbon footprint by using public transportation to participating in local eco-friendly initiatives.\n\nAs an almost constant user of the internet, Julian stays updated on current events through online news sources like The New York Times and The Guardian. Despite his busy schedule, Julian dedicates time to staying informed about policy changes and political debates, often engaging in discussions on social media platforms. However, his increasingly demanding job has limited his ability to volunteer, a fact that Julian hopes to change in the future.\n\nJulian identifies as a liberal Democrat and is registered to vote. He has been consistent in voting in both local and national elections, seeing the electoral process as a powerful tool for change. Julian's political priorities align closely with those of progressive candidates who champion environmental protection, social equality, and accessible education.\n\nIn his personal life, Julian enjoys exploring the outdoors, particularly hiking in the Columbia River Gorge and practicing yoga to manage stress. His social life revolves around a close-knit group of friends from college and work, with whom he frequently attends local events and discussions on sustainable living. Despite never having been married, Julian values close relationships and hopes to start a family someday, envisioning a future with a partner who shares his passion for environmental justice and social progress."
