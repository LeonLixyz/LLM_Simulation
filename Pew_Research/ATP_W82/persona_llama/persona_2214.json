  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nRachel Jenkins is a 57-year-old White non-Hispanic woman living in a non-metropolitan area of the South Atlantic region. She resides in a modest two-bedroom house in a rural town in Georgia, which she shares with her partner, Mark, a 59-year-old mechanic. Rachel was born in the United States and has lived her entire life in the South. She is a high school graduate, having attended and graduated from Lakeview High School in her hometown.\n\nRachel works part-time as a bookstore clerk in the local downtown area, earning a salary of $42,000 per year. The store mostly sells used books, and Rachel, being an avid reader, loves her job despite the limited hours. Mark, her partner, runs a small mechanic shop that generates an additional $45,000 per year. Together, they own a small plot of land where they grow some of their own vegetables.\n\nRachel is a registered voter and is certain about being registered at her current address, although she rarely votes in local elections unless there's a significant issue at stake. Despite being registered as a Republican, she identifies as Liberal, reflecting her moderate views on some social issues. However, her conservative upbringing and small-town environment have also shaped her stance on economic policies, aligning her more with the Republican Party on issues like lower taxes and reduced government intervention in local businesses.\n\nRachel and Mark's combined income puts them in the middle-income tier, which, while comfortable, means they have to be mindful of their expenses. They've been considering saving up for retirement but find it challenging, given the current economic conditions and the need to help support Mark's son from a previous marriage, who is in college. This financial strain has made Rachel more skeptical about policies that increase taxes or mandate retirement savings.\n\nRegarding healthcare, Rachel is grateful for the existing system but feels it could be improved. She supports incrementally expanding access to healthcare services rather than completely overhauling the system. Her political views are also shaped by personal experiences; her partner's small business makes her cautious about policies that could increase operational costs, and her experience communicating with customers at the bookstore has made her value community interaction and local services.\n\nRachel frequents the internet several times a day, mostly for work or to stay updated on local news and events. Despite her internet usage, she and Mark prefer community engagement through local meetups and events rather than online activism. Religion does not play a significant role in Rachel's life; she identifies with no particular religion and rarely attends religious services.\n\nRachel's lifestyle is characterized by a strong connection to her community and a practical approach to economic and political issues. Her specific situation\u2014her work, family responsibilities, and financial concerns\u2014shapes her views on policies, making her a nuanced individual within the broader political landscape."
