  "PERSONA": "rafael hern\u00e1ndez is a 67-year-old married man living in the metropolitan area of miami, florida. born in costa rica, he has lived in the united states for 25 years and identifies as hispanic with central american origins. rafael attended college but did not receive a degree, having completed about two years of coursework in business administration before financial constraints forced him to drop out and find work.\n\nrafael and his wife of 40 years, guadalupe, own a modest house in the hialeah neighborhood, where they have resided for over 15 years. the neighborhood is predominantly hispanic and offers a sense of community and cultural familiarity. their mortgage, which they are in the process of paying off, is around $1,100 per month, a significant expense considering their income. \n\nthe couple has two children, both of whom have moved out and started their own families. their daughter, ana, lives nearby with her husband and two kids, while their son, juan, resides in tampa with his family. regular family gatherings are central to rafael's life, and he attends church services more than once a week at a local protestant church in his neighborhood, where he serves as an accountant on a volunteer basis.\n\nrafael works as an administrative assistant for a small insurance company in the miami area, earning around $45,000 per year. he enjoys the stability and the sense of contribution this job provides. guadalupe works part-time as a nurse's aide, supplementing their income by about $10,000 annually. their combined income places them in the middle tier, but they have to budget carefully, especially considering rafael's preference for saving for retirement and his grandchildren's education.\n\ndespite his conservative leanings, rafael does not identify with any political party and prefers not to discuss politics openly, partly due to his skepticism towards the efficiency of the government in addressing issues that directly impact his community. he believes in individual effort and community support but is increasingly concerned about healthcare costs and social security for retirees like himself.\n\nrafael and guadalupe are not registered to vote at their current address due to a recent move within the county, but they intend to correct this before the next elections. rafael's lack of engagement with the voting process is not from disinterest but rather from a sense of disillusionment with the political system.\n\nrafael is very active on the internet, using it almost constantly to stay informed, manage the church's finances online, and keep in touch with family and friends. despite his conservative views and strong religious beliefs, rafael is open-minded and values education, hoping that the younger generation will push for positive change."
