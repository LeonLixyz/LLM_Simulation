  "PERSONA": "juan carlos hernandez is a 38-year-old hispanic man living in the metropolitan area of miami, florida, in the south atlantic census division. born in the dominican republic, he has been in the united states for 15 years. he identifies as mixed race, with a combination of spanish and indigenous ta\u00edno ancestry. juan is a practicing roman catholic and considers himself a born-again christian. he regularly attends mass at his local parish, typically going once or twice a month.\n\njuan is a high school graduate from his hometown in the dominican republic and has not pursued further formal education in the united states. despite the challenges, he has managed to learn english and work his way up to become a supervisor at a landscaping company. he earns around $45,000 a year, which places him in the lower-income tier. however, he prioritizes saving and budgeting, having recently started a retirement fund.\n\njuan lives with his partner, elena, in a modest two-bedroom apartment they rent in the diverse neighborhood of wynwood, miami. they are not married but have been together for seven years and are considering starting a family soon. elena works part-time as a nurse's aide, bringing in an additional $20,000 a year. together, they have a combined annual income of $65,000, which helps them make ends meet but does not leave much room for luxuries.\n\njuan's immigration status is a significant concern for him, as he is not a u.s. citizen, despite his long residency. this issue affects his economic views, as he is keenly aware of policies impacting immigration reform and how they might influence his future. his work in the landscaping sector, which is largely populated by immigrants, also makes him sensitive to labor rights and fair wages. despite his struggles with the immigration system, juan leans towards the republican party, largely due to the strong influence of his social circle and his perception of republican economic policies being more beneficial for small businesses and the working class.\n\njuan is very active on the internet, using it almost constantly for news, social media, and keeping in touch with his family back in the dominican republic. although he doesn't volunteer, he is engaged in his community through his church and participates in local fundraising events, especially those supporting education for underprivileged children.\n\njuan's political views are complex and nuanced, reflecting both liberal and conservative opinions. while he leans towards republican policies on some economic matters, his personal life experiences, especially as an immigrant, also make him sympathetic to liberal views on immigration and social welfare policies. he has voted in local elections but is not currently registered to vote in federal elections due to his immigration status, a situation he hopes will change in the future. juan's mixed beliefs and experiences make him a moderate/liberal republican, a difficult categorization that reflects the complexity of his identity as an immigrant in america."
