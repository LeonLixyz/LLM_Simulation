  "PERSONA": "meet ana mar\u00eda d\u00edaz, a 72-year-old puerto rican woman living in the metropolitan area of orlando, florida, in the south atlantic census division. ana mar\u00eda holds a bachelor's degree in early childhood education from inter american university of puerto rico and pursued some postgraduate studies in education at the university of central florida. she was born in san juan, puerto rico, but has spent a significant part of her life in the mainland united states, specifically in florida.\n\nana mar\u00eda is a proud and devoted wife to her 75-year-old husband, rafael, a retired electrician. they have been married for 49 years and have two grown children, a son who is an engineer, and a daughter who is a nurse. both of their children are married and have children of their own, making ana mar\u00eda a grandmother of five. as a result, she spends considerable time helping her children with childcare and family responsibilities.\n\ndespite her strong educational background, ana mar\u00eda's household has struggled financially. her husband's retirement pension and her part-time job as a teacher's assistant, from which she earns $25,000 annually, barely cover their living expenses. they own their modest home in a working-class neighborhood of orlando, valued at $120,000, but with an ongoing mortgage of $800 per month. ana mar\u00eda's household income falls into the lower-income category, and they often rely on coupons, special discounts, and assistance from their children to make ends meet.\n\nas a devout protestant, ana mar\u00eda regularly attends church services more than once a week. she values her faith and finds comfort in it, especially during difficult times. her religiosity influences her views on social issues, such as abortion and lgbtq+ rights, which she tends to oppose based on her understanding of biblical teachings.\n\nana mar\u00eda is an avid user of the internet, relying on it for social connections, information, and staying up to date on local and national news. however, she has never participated in volunteer work and isn't a registered voter at her current address, which may indicate a sense of disconnection from the broader civic and community engagement processes.\n\nthis fiscal frugality and situational vulnerability typically would lead ana mar\u00eda toward democrats due to their emphasis on supporting the poor. but ana mar\u00eda's embedded conservative orientation via her religious background moves her aside from declaring any allegiance officially.\n\nin terms of economic and political views, ana mar\u00eda is most concerned about healthcare, specifically the affordable care act and social security. with rafael's ongoing health issues and their reliance on his retirement benefits, she cautiousley watches policy changes and debates around these topics closely, seeking to ensure their stability. given her perspective, while officially undecided, her leanings align more with progressive fiscal policies on healthcare access, which majorly influences her when assessing and taking stances on candidates."
