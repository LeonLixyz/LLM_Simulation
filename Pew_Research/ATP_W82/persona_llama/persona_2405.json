  "PERSONA": "deborah \"debbie\" thompson, a 58-year-old woman living in the metropolitan area of tampa, florida, with her long-term partner of 12 years, james. debbie was born in tampa, florida, and has never lived anywhere else. she identifies as a white non-hispanic protestant and regularly attends her local church, where she sings in the choir.\n\ndebbie's educational background consists of an associate's degree in early childhood education from hillsborough community college, which she completed after attending a local high school. she initially pursued this degree to become a kindergarten teacher but soon realized her passion lay in childcare. as a result, she opened her own home daycare in 1995, which operated until 2012 when the housing market crash forced her to close the business due to reduced demand. she had 10 children in her care at the peak but eventually scaled down to a smaller number before shutting down.\n\nshe currently works as a part-time librarian at the local tampa-hillsborough county public library, where she assists patrons with finding materials and teaches children's storytime. debbie works 25 hours per week and earns an annual income of $28,500, supplemented by her partner james' income as a freelance carpenter. their combined household income is around $45,000 a year.\n\ndebbie and james live in a cozy 3-bedroom, 1-bathroom house in the west tampa neighborhood, which they purchased in 1999. they are currently struggling to pay their mortgage, which was initially $800 a month but has increased to $1,100 after the interest rate reset. as a result, they have been in arrears and fear foreclosure. however, the home's location close to debbie's work, local parks, and family ties makes it essential for them.\n\nthough debbie and james are not married, they share three children from previous relationships and two grandchildren, for whom they provide around $500 per month in support. this further strains their finances, but family is essential to them.\n\na strict budget limits their household spending, allocating $200 for meals, $500 for groceries, $100 for entertainment, and $200 for miscellaneous expenses, aside from regular deductions for utilities, insurance, and the mortgage.\n\npolitically, debbie is a moderate democrat, supporting progressive policies that assist the working class, promote education, and provide economic relief for struggling families. her main concern is the accessibility of affordable housing, given their ongoing mortgage struggles and observations of neighbors experiencing similar or worse difficulties. she has consistently voted in local and national elections and encourages others within her social circle to do so.\n\ndebbie values volunteering, having participated in her church's food bank, school literacy programs, and local clean-up events. however, she has not volunteered in recent years due to the demands of her part-time job, household responsibilities, and caring for her grandchildren.\n\nshe uses the internet several times a day to access work emails, job searching platforms, ebay for second-hand shopping, social networks like facebook, and research similar houses for potential downsizing due to financial strain.\n\ndebbie's top concerns regarding government policies include education, economic relief measures, and accessible affordable housing. having 'refinanced' her home, purchased in 1999, in 2007 she is stressed about the fate of michele's proposal suggesting all federal programs related to homeownership should focus on supporting purchasers and developers in the private market instead of individual homeowners struggling to make ends meet or stay in their homes."
