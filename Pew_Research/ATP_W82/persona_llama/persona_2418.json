  "PERSONA": "meet 25-year-old ethan thompson, a mid-twenties software engineer living in the metropolitan area of columbus, ohio, specifically in the clintonville neighborhood. born and raised in the midwest, ethan is a lifelong resident of ohio, having grown up in a middle-class family in a suburban town just outside of columbus. he is a white non-hispanic male who identifies as an independent with a lean towards the republican party, largely due to his moderate views on economic and social issues.\n\nethan graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science from ohio state university three years ago and has been working for a mid-sized tech firm in columbus, specializing in software development for the healthcare industry. he earns $55,000 annually, with benefits, which places him firmly in the middle-income bracket. ethan lives in a two-bedroom apartment in clintonville, which he rents with a roommate for $1,200 a month. his monthly expenses include a $400 car loan payment for his used honda civic, $100 for a streaming service bundle, and a combined phone and internet bill of $150.\n\npolitically, ethan identifies as moderate, believing in a balanced approach to government spending and social programs. he leans towards the republican party due to his views on taxation and business regulation but doesn't strongly affiliate with either party. ethan's main economic concerns are student loan debt, affordable healthcare, and ensuring job security in the tech industry. he supports policies that encourage entrepreneurship and technological innovation but is hesitant about blanket increases in taxes to fund social welfare programs.\n\nethan's educational background has significantly influenced his career trajectory. he was an average student in high school but excelled in computer science courses, which led him to pursue the field in college. his degree from a reputable institution like ohio state has been instrumental in securing a well-paying job in his desired field. ethan sees the value in higher education but thinks there should be more practical, vocational training options available, given the rising costs of attending college.\n\nas someone who rarely attends religious services, ethan describes his religious views as 'nothing in particular.' he was raised in a non-denominational christian household but has grown less observant with age. despite this, ethan maintains a strong sense of community responsibility and occasionally volunteers at local tech meetups to teach coding to young students. he believes in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, making time for hobbies such as reading science fiction and participating in a local recreational soccer league.\n\ngrowing up in a family with two working parents (his mother was a nurse, and his father worked in sales), ethan learned the importance of hard work and saving. his parents' guidance instilled in him the value of financial responsibility, leading him to navigate his own finances cautiously. he hopes to save enough to buy a house in the next five years, settling down in a more suburban area of columbus. ethan's financial aspirations include paying off his car loan and starting a savings plan for retirement, although he thinks there should be more widespread access to secure, employer-matched 401(k) plans for workers in the tech field.\n\nregarding his voting status, ethan is likely registered to vote, although he hasn't checked his registration status in a while. he follows politics closely through online news sources and podcasts, using his internet connection almost constantly. ethan appreciates well-articulated, data-driven arguments and considers his moderate ideology to be a result of his independent nature and aversion to extreme viewpoints."
