  "PERSONA": "alex johnson, a 57-year-old white non-hispanic male, born and raised in the united states in the metropolitan area of new york city, specifically in the brooklyn borough's bay ridge neighborhood. alex is a married man, in a long-term marriage of 28 years to his high school sweetheart, debbie. they have two adult children, with emily, 24, working as an elementary school teacher and alex jr., 21, a junior at nearby brooklyn college.\n\ngrowing up in a traditional, middle-class neighborhood, alex received a high school diploma from a local public school. due to financial constraints at home and not having much interest in pursuing college, he entered the workforce immediately after graduation. he worked multiple jobs until landing a relatively stable position as a maintenance supervisor for the new york city transit authority at the age of 25, a role he still holds today.\n\nalex and his family live in the same modest, two-story house they purchased in 1990. they have a $425,000 mortgage, which they expect to pay off in 5 years. currently, they are paying $36,000 in annual property taxes and $18,000 for private insurance. alex's annual income is $87,011, which adds to debbie's $32,145 income from working as an administrative assistant in a local medical practice, making their combined family income $119,156.\n\nalex has become increasingly concerned with rising healthcare costs, crime rates in their neighborhood, and high local taxes. being an active online user ( checking the internet several times a day), he's informed about current issues, particularly focusing on the effects of rising taxes on the middle class and believes it's time for new local policies that address oversight and management. his experiences make him very conservative and skeptical of increased government intervention into personal and local affairs.\n\nalex is an avid supporter of law enforcement, strong national defense, and education. despite his faith, he doesn't regularly attend religious services; however, he is more likely to volunteer in local school or community activities rather than join protest movements. he definitely opposes any policy that increases government control or taxes and supports spurring job growth for small businesses.\n\ndue to his party identification as a republican, on his ballot, you're more likely to see him vote for candidates who are tough on crime, believe in strengthening law enforcement, cutting back on wasteful spending, and not sensitive to high taxes.\n\nthough currently pretty disinterested in actively volunteering or participating in politics beyond voting, alex definitely could become involved in grassroots activities or protests should the policy agendas that deeply affect him be heavily targeted.\n\nthough he maintains regular updates with the digital sphere, discussing politics online isn't alex's thing and is careful not to broach the subject unless strongly provoked - however he is way more likely to venture into support for people that connect and influence directly his local concerns"
