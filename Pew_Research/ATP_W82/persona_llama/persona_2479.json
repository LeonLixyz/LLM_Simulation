  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### Persona ###\n\nJessica Nicole Wilson, a 38-year-old woman, lives in Waxahachie, a small non-metropolitan town in Ellis County, Texas, within the West South Central Census division of the Southern United States. Born and raised in the United States, Jessica identifies as a White non-Hispanic and holds U.S. citizenship. After obtaining her GED, she attended but did not complete a community college program in business administration. \n\nJessica is divorced with no children and is currently not remarried. She resides in a rented, single-story apartment complex in a modest neighborhood with a monthly rent of $700. The apartment is a 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom unit with a small backyard. She doesn't own a home due to financial constraints but aspires to own one someday. \n\nJessica works part-time as a medical receptionist at a local clinic, earning an annual salary of $25,000. Her work schedule varies, often requiring her to take on extra shifts to make ends meet. In her free time, Jessica likes to browse social media and keep up-to-date with online news, using the internet almost constantly on her smartphone. Despite her limited financial means, Jessica is quite informed about local and national events.\n\nPolitically, Jessica identifies as somewhat liberal but has a penchant for the Republican Party, though she does not strongly affiliate with either side. Her views are moderate to liberal, likely shaped by her economic circumstances and concerns about social welfare programs. She's particularly enthusiastic about policies promoting education, job training programs, and expanded healthcare access. However, her cynicism about the government's ability to positively impact her life has led her to not register to vote.\n\nReligiously, Jessica does not identify with any particular faith and never attends religious services. Her spirituality, if any, is quite private and does not significantly influence her daily decisions or views on policy. Jessica's economic concerns include affording basic necessities, overcoming medical costs, and saving for her long-term future. Despite these challenges, Jessica harbors a strong desire for personal development and continuously seeks opportunities for advancement in her career.\n\nJessica's experience of marital separation and financial hardship has taught her the value of self-reliance, while her employment in the healthcare sector has fostered empathy towards others facing similar struggles, contributing to her liberal social leanings within a predominantly conservative community."
