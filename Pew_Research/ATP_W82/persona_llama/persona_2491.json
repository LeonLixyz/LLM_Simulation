  "PERSONA": "**\n\nmeet thomas (tom) bradley, a 57-year-old divorced male living in the metropolitan area of jacksonville, florida, in the south atlantic region of the united states. born and raised in the united states, tom identifies as white non-hispanic and has no hispanic origin. a lifelong resident of the south, tom grew up and spent most of his life in the jacksonville area, where he currently resides in a modest, single-family home in a mixed-income neighborhood.\n\n**education and career:**\ntom graduated from high school in 1985 and immediately entered the workforce to support his family, as his father had passed away a year prior. he took on various blue-collar jobs, eventually securing stable employment as a maintenance worker for the local city government, where he has worked for over 20 years. while his job has provided financial stability, it has limited opportunities for advancement and salary growth, which has made it challenging for tom to improve his economic situation.\n\n**economic situation:**\ntom's annual income is $45,000, placing him firmly in the middle-income bracket. his income, though not spectacular, allows him to cover his living expenses and maintain a modest lifestyle, albeit with some financial stress. he owns his home, a purchase made possible by a va loan (as his father was a veteran), with a mortgage that has become increasingly manageable as the house has appreciated in value over the years. however, after his divorce, his ex-wife moved out, and he now lives alone, reducing the income but also the living expenses.\n\n**family and relationships:**\nafter his divorce, tom's relationship with his ex-wife has been strained but amicable for the sake of their two adult children, both in their late twenties and pursuing higher education. tom is proud of their educational aspirations but worries about the financial burden of their college expenses. his daughter is looking to become a teacher, and his son is pursuing a degree in engineering. tom values family highly and supports his children financially as much as possible within his means.\n\n**political views and religiosity:**\npolitically, tom leans democratic but doesn't align strictly with the party's ideologies, hence identifying as \"something else\" with a lean towards the democratic party. he considers himself moderate, prioritizing economic stability, social welfare, and environmental protection. tom is not actively religious and identifies as unaffiliated, never attending religious services. his view on religion is more of a personal and private matter, believing it's crucial for personal guidance but not necessarily for governance or policy-making.\n\n**internet and community engagement:**\ntom is moderately tech-savvy, using the internet several times a day for information, entertainment, and keeping in touch with his children and friends. despite his moderate use of technology, tom has not engaged in volunteer work or community activities beyond his immediate family and professional responsibilities. his economic concerns and family obligations consume most of his time and energy.\n\n**influences on economic and political views:**\ntom's economic situation and family responsibilities greatly influence his economic and political views. he supports policies that promote job security, affordable education, and healthcare access. tom is also concerned about environmental issues but feels these concerns often conflict with economic realities and job security in his region. given his mixed-income neighborhood, he has witnessed firsthand the impact of environmental degradation and its effects on community health and property values. despite these concerns, tom's immediate economic needs and the well-being of his children take precedence in his political priorities.\n\ngiven tom's lifelong experience in the south atlantic region, his moderate political views, and his focus on economic security and family, his perspective offers a nuanced understanding of middle-aged, middle-income individuals in the united states."
