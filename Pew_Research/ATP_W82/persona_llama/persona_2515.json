  "PERSONA": "meet 38-year-old maya, a proud indigenous black non-hispanic woman who lives in denver, colorado, a bustling metropolitan city right at the heart of the mountain division of the western united states. maya's age, though not explicitly stated, is deduced from the assumption of reaching a middle-income tier and owning a house (later deduced) after undertaking various life milestones such as education and career establishment which generally begin after the late teenage years.\n\nmaya holds some college credits, but she opted not to pursue a degree. instead, she chose to focus on her career in non-profit management after taking courses in business administration. maya is the executive director at a local community organization dedicated to environmental conservation and community development, drawing a yearly income of $45,000. she finds this position fulfilling, given her strong passion for volunteer work and agnostic beliefs that focus on humanitarian causes rather than spiritual enlightenment. \n\ndespite identifying as an agnostic, maya was raised in a liberal christian household, which significantly shaped her values of compassion, community, and social justice. her early exposure to diverse ideologies and her late husband's influence as a liberal democrat has solidified her stance as a liberal democrat. before his untimely passing, her husband and she had discussed plans to expand their environmental efforts, possibly into politics, after he finished his law degree. maya's current house in a suburban neighborhood on the outskirts of denver, which they bought together, serves as a poignant reminder of his vision and her ongoing efforts to realize it.\n\nas a registered voter, maya is deeply invested in her community and votes in nearly every election. online platforms have become indispensable to her. she uses them almost constantly, staying updated on current events and issues relevant to her work and interests. this online engagement often prompts her to participate in local activism and encourage her family and friends to do the same.\n\nmaya volunteers at a nearby community garden, which has provided a much-needed sense of connection since her loss. while she considers herself middle class and generally content with her income, maya does worry about affording repairs for her house, built in the 1990s. the struggle to maintain the house is a constant reminder of the economic burdens she faces as a widow and the broader issues she believes need to be addressed, such as housing affordability, accessible education, and the importance of protecting the environment. maya's children, aged 10 and 12, inherited their parents' values, often joining her in community activities and fostering an atmosphere of social responsibility and engagement at home."
