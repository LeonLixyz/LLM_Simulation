  "PERSONA": "###\n\nharold \"hal\" thompson, a 68-year-old retired mechanic, lives with his 65-year-old wife, margaret, in a cozy two-bedroom house in the suburbs of birmingham, alabama. born and raised in the united states, specifically in the east south central region, hal is a proud white non-hispanic man who identifies as a protestant and occasionally attends church services, but not regularly. he holds a high school diploma, which was enough for him to secure a stable job at a local car dealership's repair shop, where he spent most of his working life.\n\nhal and margaret, a retired school teacher, have been married for 42 years and have two adult sons, both away at college when their parents were in their early twenties. their sons are now grown with families of their own; they see their grandchildren often. despite hal not being extremely active in his community (given his retired status), he regularly keeps in touch with friends through social media, where he spends a lot of time when not watching television.\n\ngiven hal's income, amounting to $72,000 per year, largely from his retirement fund as a direct result of his 30 years of hard work in the dealership and a bit from his wife's teaching pension, they consider themselves part of the middle class. his annual family income puts food on the table and allows them modest vacations every year or so. considering retirement often frees up time that could otherwise be spent working or dealing with work-related activities, this splitting of free time, generally outside the realm of attending religious services, generally makes hal's conservative lifestyle regularly come to light through how he views policies about healthcare and coverage for processes particularly concerning aging.\n\nhal's voting record shows him strictly voting republican, as seen in the last local mayoral election, further solidifying the evidence that he identifies as conservative, voting in every election."
