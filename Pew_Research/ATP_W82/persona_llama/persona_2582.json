  "PERSONA": "rajesh \"raj\" patel, a 42-year-old indian-american man, married to rohini, a dentist, with two children, ages 10 and 7. born in mumbai, india, raj immigrated to the united states 17 years ago to pursue his master's degree in computer science at the university of texas. he now resides in a suburban neighborhood of dallas, texas, in a four-bedroom, two-story house he bought 10 years ago for $450,000 with a current mortgage of $2,800 per month.\n\nraj holds a master's degree in computer science and works as a senior it project manager at a fortune 500 company, with a salary of $140,000 per year. his wife, rohini, has her own successful dental practice in the area, grossing around $250,000 annually. together, they have a combined household income of $390,000, placing them firmly in the upper-income bracket. despite his strong financial situation, raj often worries about the implications of tax reforms on his family's income and the future costs of his children's education.\n\nraj values his hindu faith and attends temple services with his family a few times a year, participating in cultural festivals and community events. he strongly believes in the importance of education, stemming from his own experiences navigating the complexities of the u.s. education system as an international student and later sponsoring his wife's education in dental school.\n\nwhile raj's economic situation is comfortable, his lack of u.s. citizenship makes him cautious about expressing overt political views despite identifying as liberal. his primary concerns are healthcare, quality education for all, and immigration reform. he and his wife frequently discuss these issues, drawing from their own experiences as immigrants. their household celebrates both hindu and american traditions, reflecting their blended cultural identity.\n\nraj spends a significant amount of time online, frequently using the internet to stay informed about current events, follow news on india, and connect with friends and family around the world. despite being well-informed, he hesitates to lean towards any political party, considering himself somewhat disillusioned with both major parties on the subject of immigration and education policy. raj's user name on social media platforms reflects his humor during his college days, @texastiger88, a nod to the texas longhorns mascot and his birth year."
