  "PERSONA": "kareem ali, a 38-year-old, black, non-hispanic man, was born and raised in newark, new jersey, within the new york metropolitan area. he has been a lifelong resident of the northeast and has spent most of his life navigating urban life, experiencing firsthand the diversity and opportunities the region offers. \n\nafter graduating from east side high school, one of the most diverse high schools in newark, kareem's interest in urban planning and community development led him to take various certification courses in environmental sustainability and green building, expanding on his high school education.\n\nkareem works two jobs to make ends meet. his main job is as an assistant maintenance coordinator for a property management firm overseeing several residential buildings in newark and surrounding areas. this role pays him approximately $24,000 a year. in his free time, kareem is an arts educator at a local community center, where he teaches ceramics and sculptures, making about $4,000 a year.\n\ndespite his two jobs, his annual income remains under $30,000, making his living situation a bit strained. however, his dedication to serving the community and passion for creating safe and environmentally conscious housing keeps him going.\n\nkareem has never been married, but he feels a strong sense of family obligation, taking care of his elderly grandmother in his house. he has chosen not to invest in homeownership to keep more financial flexibility but instead lives in a small 2-bedroom rental apartment in the weequahic neighborhood, a historic and culturally diverse area in newark.\n\nkareem's lack of disposable income affects his internet usage, often using his phone to access the internet almost constantly but rarely purchasing digital gadgets or making online purchases, despite his interest in technology and its potential to make urban living more sustainable.\n\nhe considers himself a very liberal democrat and frequently stays engaged with politics, usually turning to online news sources or local community radio stations to stay informed. given his background, he prioritizes policies focused on urban renewal, social justice, and access to affordable education. despite his strong views, kareem rarely volunteers due to his commitment to two jobs, but he keeps an open heart for supporting causes through activism when possible. his hectic work life keeps him from attending religious services regularly; however, his values of inclusivity and tolerance often stem from his secular upbringing.\n\nkareem would more often than not vote with progressive urban renewal projects in mind and care deeply about the existing homelessness issues affecting his beloved city. as a result, candidates or policies that address the plight of marginalized communities in cities resonate with him, pushing for a better income rotation that perhaps would provide people like him greater stability and autonomy in making educated decisions about what they value most."
