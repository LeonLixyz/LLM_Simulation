  "PERSONA": "meet carolyn wilson, a 57-year-old married woman living in suburban charleston, south carolina. she was born in a small town in south carolina but moved to the charleston area about 25 years ago. as a high school graduate, carolyn finished her education at the local garners ferry high school and, later, took a few business administration courses at midlands technical college but never pursued a degree. \n\ncarolyn works as a part-time administrative assistant at a medium-sized insurance firm based in downtown charleston. her husband, robert, 59, works full-time as a mechanical engineer for a manufacturing company in nearby north charleston, and their combined income falls just below $90,000. carolyn's work schedule typically involves 25 hours of work each week, with some variation based on the company's needs. she values the stability and flexibility her job provides, which allows her to help care for her mother in her 80s, who lives about an hour's drive away and has mobility issues. \n\ncarolyn's cost of living is modest; she and robert bought their current home in a quiet charleston suburb 10 years ago for approximately $250,000 and have managed to keep mortgage payments under control. their current home value is around $350,000. they drive two cars, including a 5-year-old toyota suv that carolyn uses for work and personal errands, and a 2-year-old chevrolet pickup truck for her husband's work commute.\n\ncarolyn is not very active in public or community service, citing her commitment to her mother and husband as her priority. however, she occasionally participates in charity auctions and social events at her workplace. her proficiency in internet usage (about once a day) is largely limited to work-related tasks, checking news, and contacting friends and family through email and social media. \n\ncarolyn and robert are conservative republicans, occasionally attending local rallies and presidential debates. religious in her upbringing, carolyn now attends church a few times a year, typically on holidays like christmas or easter, as she claims that her busy schedule can make regular church attendance difficult. despite this, her faith remains an important part of her life, influencing her views on social and moral issues.\n\ncarolyn is an avid supporter of local economic initiatives aimed at minimizing tax burdens for lower- to middle-income families and called for a balanced state budget to address growing infrastructure concerns. at a national level, carolyn forecasts economic instability and demands fiscal accountability, supporting a fiscally conservative policy direction."
