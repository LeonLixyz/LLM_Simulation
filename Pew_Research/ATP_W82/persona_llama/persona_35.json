  "PERSONA": "agnes marie o'connor, a 72-year-old widow, lives in a modest two-bedroom apartment in the city of worcester, massachusetts, within the new england metropolitan area. born and raised in worcester, she has resided in the same neighborhood for over 50 years. agnes attended and graduated from st. peter-marian central catholic high school before pursuing a 30-year career as an administrative assistant in a local catholic school system. after retiring in 2010, she dedicates her time to volunteering at the worcester senior center, where she helps with administrative tasks.\n\nagnes was married to john, a mechanic, for 40 years until his passing in 2015. they had two sons, michael and thomas, both of whom live in the same city with their families. agnes finds solace in her catholic faith and regularly attends mass at st. john's catholic church, where she has been a member since childhood.\n\nagnes's annual household income is approximately $25,000, primarily composed of her social security benefits and a modest pension from her years of service in the catholic school system. her late husband's ira account provides a small annual stipend for household expenses. as a homeowner-turned-renter after her husband's passing, agnes now pays $900 per month for a two-bedroom apartment in a building for seniors.\n\nshe adheres to the teachings of the roman catholic church and often reflects on how these values inform her relatively conservative views on social issues. despite her conservative leanings, agnes remains an independent and prefers to decide on political matters based on the situation rather than solely following party lines.\n\nagnes uses the internet several times a week to stay informed on local news, chat with her family through email and social media, and keep updated on catholic community events. her volunteer work allows her to engage with the local community, and her experience taking care of her husband during his final years has deepened her concern for affordable healthcare access for seniors.\n\nagnes values honesty, kindness, and fairness. however, her concerns about economic inequality, affordable housing, and the pension crisis for seniors often influence her conservative stance, especially on issues like income tax reform and state pension plan funding. agnes's approach to selecting candidates for local and national elections emphasizes their stance on social security, healthcare costs, and the overall treatment of seniors in their policy platforms.\n\noverall, agnes represents the voice of a liberal-conservative fence-sitter among senior citizens who far more regularly practice their faith and tie their faith to moral-accountability and 'what is right and wrong.'"
