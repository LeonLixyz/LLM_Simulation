Born and raised in Ponce, Puerto Rico, Rafa moved to the United States 15 years ago in search of better job opportunities and a more stable life. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen 8 years ago and has been a registered voter ever since.\n\nEducation:\nRafa attended the Universidad de Puerto Rico for two years, studying business administration, before deciding to move to the U.S. to pursue a better job market. After relocating, he took some courses in English as a second language and a certification program in HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) repair.\n\nCareer:\nRafa works as an HVAC technician for a small, family-owned business in New Haven. He earns approximately $25,000 per year, which is just enough to cover his living expenses. Rafa's job is physically demanding, and he often works long hours, but he takes pride in his work and enjoys helping people stay comfortable in their homes.\n\nFamily and Social Life:\nRafa's family is very important to him. His parents and younger sister still live in Puerto Rico, and he tries to visit them at least once a year. He has a small, close-knit group of friends in New Haven, mostly fellow Puerto Ricans who share similar interests in music, food, and culture. Rafa never married, but he has a long-term girlfriend, Mar\u00eda, who works as a nurse at a local hospital.\n\nHome and Finances:\nRafa rents a small, one-bedroom apartment in a modest building in Fair Haven. He pays $900 per month, which is about 40% of his take-home pay. He has no savings, and his debt includes a credit card balance and a car loan. Rafa is concerned about his financial security and tries to be frugal with his expenses.\n\nPolitics and Values:\nAs a moderate Democrat, Rafa tends to favor progressive policies, especially those that benefit working-class individuals and immigrants. He is passionate about environmental issues, healthcare reform, and workers' rights. Rafa is not very active in politics, but he votes regularly and tries to stay informed about local and national issues. He values hard work, family, and respect for others, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nReligion and Spirituality:\nRafa was raised Catholic but considers himself unaffiliated with any particular religion. He believes in a higher power but doesn't attend church regularly. He does, however, celebrate traditional Puerto Rican holidays and participates in cultural events that honor his heritage.\n\nTechnology and Leisure:\nRafa uses the internet occasionally, mainly to stay in touch with family and friends, check news, and watch his favorite sports teams (New York Yankees and FC Barcelona). He enjoys listening to salsa and classic rock music, cooking traditional Puerto Rican dishes, and playing dominoes with his friends.\n\nOverall, Rafa is a hardworking, family-oriented individual who values his cultural heritage and is committed to making a better life for himself in the United States. Despite the challenges he faces, Rafa remains optimistic about his future and is eager to contribute to his community."
