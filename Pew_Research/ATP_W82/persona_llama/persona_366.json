  "PERSONA": "michael j. thompson\n\nmichael is a 57-year-old white non-hispanic man who resides in the seattle metropolitan area, specifically in the suburb of tacoma, washington. he was born and raised in the united states and has never been married. \n\nwith an associate's degree in avionics maintenance technology from a local community college, michael has worked as a maintenance technician at a small, privately-owned aircraft repair facility near tacoma for the past 15 years. his current annual income is approximately $28,000, making him a lower-income earner, who sometimes struggles to make ends meet.\n\nliving in a modest one-bedroom apartment in a low-rise complex near downtown tacoma, michael's largest monthly expense, apart from rent ($850), is his car loan for a 2012 honda civic. his apartment, while small, allows him to be within walking distance of local shops and services. his close proximity to seattle also makes it relatively easy to visit the nearby city.\n\nthough he is an independent voter with a lean towards the republican party, his support tends towards conservative policies due mainly to his social upbringing and personal financial struggles which lead him to prioritize self-reliance and smaller government. his views on policies are mostly informed by news articles and discussions found online, where he spends a considerable amount of time. michael uses the internet almost constantly, although mostly for casual browsing and social media.\n\nmichael's lack of a strong religious affiliation reflects his upbringing; his family members mostly identified as non-practicing christians, and his hometown in washington had low religious service attendance. at present, he does not attend religious services and describes his religious views as 'nothing in particular.'\n\ndespite michael's independent nature, his financial constraints often lead him to think critically about budget policies and the cost of living, particularly regarding healthcare, which he utilizes sporadically for minor issues. due to age and health concerns, these are becoming increasingly important factors in his political considerations.\n\nas michael's associates are aware of his views and leanings, discussions on economic and policy issues are frequent, and his opinion is often centered around conservative fiscal management, and economic freedom, but tempered by his practical experience of living close to the financial edge."
