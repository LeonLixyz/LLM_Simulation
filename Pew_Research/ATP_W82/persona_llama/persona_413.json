  "PERSONA": "aidan lewis is a 25-year-old white, non-hispanic male living in the metropolitan area of charlotte, north carolina, a major city in the south atlantic region. born in the united states, aidan has spent his entire life in the u.s. he is a conservative republican with a moderate stance on various issues, aligning with his conservative upbringing in a traditional southern setting.\n\naidan attended a local community college but never completed his degree due to financial constraints. after attending college for two years, he realized that he couldn't afford to continue his studies and decided to focus on his career instead. he currently works as a part-time customer service representative at a local electronics store, earning approximately $35,000 annually.\n\naidan lives in a rented apartment in the downtown area of charlotte, a neighborhood that's seen significant development in recent years but still faces gentrification. he pays $800 per month in rent, which takes up nearly half of his income after taxes. he's not registered to vote, mainly due to his lack of engagement in local politics and a busy work schedule.\n\ngrowing up in a conservative household in the south, aidan identifies as a republican and leans toward conservative ideologies. however, he doesn't consider himself an evangelical or 'born-again' christian, as he considers himself an atheist, separating him from the more religious factions within the republican party.\n\naidan spends most of his free time browsing social media and video-sharing platforms on his phone, staying up-to-date with the latest news, pop culture, and technology trends. his favorite social media platforms are twitter, instagram, and youtube. despite being an internet enthusiast, aidan is not an active participant in online communities, rarely posting content or engaging in discussions.\n\naidan's social circle consists mainly of coworkers from the electronics store, friends from community college, and acquaintances from his neighborhood. they share similar interests in gaming, movies, and sports but rarely engage in deep, meaningful conversations about politics or social issues.\n\naidan never married and does not have any dependents, which allows him to maintain his modest lifestyle. however, his economic situation worries him. aidan believes the cost of living is rising too quickly and feels that local politicians aren't doing enough to address housing affordability. he hopes for politicians to create incentives for developers to build more affordable housing. when thinking about his economic future, aidan's number one priority is to find a higher-paying job or land a promotion to increase his annual salary.\n\ndespite his conservative views, aidan does not identify as an extreme ideologue. he takes a measured approach to decision-making, weighing multiple perspectives before forming an opinion. aidan leans conservative on issues such as taxes, shrinking government size, and limited social welfare, which is a direct result of his upbringing and upbringing in a relatively affluent suburban neighborhood. when considering candidate voting preferences, aidan leans towards pragmatic centre-right candidates rather than the more extreme conservative figures.\n\nregardless of his political preferences, aidan's cynicism about the voting process and his principled disengagement mean that he is not currently registered to vote. his lack of enthusiasm is largely a result of feeling disconnected from the washington establishment and that voting will not \"create real change\" in his life."
