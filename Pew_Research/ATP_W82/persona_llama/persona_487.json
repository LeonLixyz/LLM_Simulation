  "PERSONA": "russell \"russ\" thompson, a 57-year-old married white non-hispanic man, lives in a small town in rural louisiana, about 45 miles northwest of baton rouge. born and raised in the united states, he grew up in a working-class family and obtained a ged after dropping out of high school in the tenth grade. currently, he works as a mechanic at a local automotive repair shop, earning a yearly salary of $37,000.\n\nruss is a devout protestant and attends church services at least once a week at the first united methodist church of his hometown. his faith plays a significant role in shaping his moderate to liberal views within the context of the republican party. this lean towards moderation is further reflected in his being a self-described \"born-again\" christian.\n\nruss and his wife, debbie, have been married for 30 years, and they have two adult children, both of whom have moved out of the family home. their son, ryan, 25, works as a teacher in a nearby town, and their 28-year-old daughter, rachel, is a part-time beautician in their hometown. debbie works part-time as an administrative assistant at the local county clerk's office.\n\nruss is not overly active on the internet, checking his email and browsing the web about once a day. he occasionally engages with local online forums to discuss community news and town events. despite not being too active online, he does own a smartphone and has basic knowledge of technology.\n\ntheir annual family income places them firmly in the middle-income tier. they have faced financial challenges, particularly after the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down the auto repair shop russ works at. however, they managed to keep their household afloat with government assistance and cutbacks on discretionary spending.\n\nliving in a non-metropolitan area with a growing focus on local economic growth, russ's family purchased their home for $120,000 in 1999, which has appreciated in value to $190,000 today. they have an outstanding mortgage of $60,000 with a monthly payment of about $550. they believe owning a home has been the wisest investment decision they've ever made.\n\nruss's primary economic concerns center around rising healthcare costs and taxes. he feels people in his income bracket often end up with higher tax burdens that cut deep into their already strained finances and wants the government to simplify tax policies to ease the middle class.\n\nfrom his perspective as a small-town citizen, russ is disillusioned with the tendency towards \"party-line\" voting and wishes politicians would find a middle ground. despite having registered as a republican, he's willing to break party lines to support policies that make practical sense for the common man and favors moderate gubernatorial candidates that address localized problems over federal or highly polarizing issues.\n\nin this election, he seeks a practical approach to tackling the economy, such as seeing infrastructure spending directed at smaller towns like his to boost local job creation, and would want to support a candidate promoting healthier cooperation between federal, state, and local governments to steer his community towards fiscal recovery and sustainability."
