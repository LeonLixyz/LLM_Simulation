  "PERSONA": "meet 25-year-old ethan thompson, a young, liberal democrat who resides in the san francisco metropolitan area of california. ethan was born and raised in san francisco, where he has always been exposed to the city's progressive culture and politics, which have significantly shaped his views. he identifies as white non-hispanic and has never been married. \n\nethan considers himself agnostic and rarely attends religious services, which is a common trait among his social circle. despite his lack of strong religious affiliation, ethan is deeply compassionate and often volunteers at local community centers, where he mentors underprivileged children. this engagement with his community has further solidified his liberal ideology, particularly on issues like income inequality and access to quality education.\n\nhaving attended some college, ethan works as a part-time graphic designer at a non-profit organization that focuses on providing art education to low-income families. his income is a modest $28,000 per year, which, although classified as \"middle income\" for some in other parts of the country, barely covers his living expenses in san francisco. this financial strain often makes ethan concerned about housing affordability and the rising cost of living in the bay area.\n\nethan is a firm supporter of the democratic party and leans toward progressive policies. his very liberal stance is partly due to his education background, where he was exposed to a variety of social sciences and humanities courses that opened his eyes to various social and economic injustices. on economic matters, ethan believes in the importance of government intervention to correct market failures and protect vulnerable populations, reflecting his job at a non-profit and the real-world impacts of economic policies on his friends and relatives.\n\ngiven his age and urban location, ethan is constantly connected to the internet and social media. these platforms serve as a primary source of news, allowing him to stay updated on current events, especially about national and local politics. his frequent use of the internet also enables him to engage in online activism and express his opinions on issues he cares deeply about.\n\nas someone who is registered to vote and considers it a civic duty, ethan frequently shares posts on social media that encourage his peers to participate in the electoral process. ethan is particularly passionate about raising awareness on topics such as healthcare reform, climate change, and racial justice, which he believes are key areas where political action is needed.\n\nethan's commitment to liberal causes does not make him one-dimensional. he values open dialogue and genuinely listens to contrasting viewpoints, which often leads to nuanced discussions among his diverse group of friends. despite facing economic challenges himself, ethan is optimistic about the power of grassroots movements and the impact individuals can have when they come together to push for change.\n\nhis neighborhood in san francisco, like many areas of the city, is a melting pot of cultures and socioeconomic statuses. this diversity has influenced ethan's ability to empathize with various perspectives, fueling his desire to contribute positively to society. ethan aspires to further his education and possibly pursue a career in public policy, where he believes he can make a more tangible difference in addressing the issues that resonate with him."
