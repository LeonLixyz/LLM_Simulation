He was born in Dallas and has lived there all his life. Mark holds a Master's degree in Business Administration from Southern Methodist University, which he obtained after completing his undergraduate degree in Finance at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nMark works as a senior financial analyst at a mid-sized energy company in downtown Dallas, earning an annual salary of $125,000. His wife, Sarah, is a part-time elementary school teacher, and her income is around $40,000 per year. They own a three-bedroom house in the suburb of Plano, which they purchased 10 years ago for $280,000; its current value is around $450,000. They have a combined family income of $165,000, placing them in the middle-income tier.\n\nMark is a devoted Christian and regularly attends Sunday services at his local Presbyterian church. His strong faith and conservative values significantly influence his political views, leading him to identify as a Republican and vote accordingly in local and national elections. He is convinced of the importance of personal responsibility, limited government intervention in the economy, and a strong national defense.\n\nAs a frequent internet user, Mark stays informed about current events through online news sources such as Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Despite his busy schedule, he occasionally participates in online forums discussing politics and economic issues, but he rarely engages in in-person volunteering due to time constraints.\n\nAs a homeowner with a significant mortgage, Mark's top economic concerns include maintaining low interest rates and a stable housing market. Additionally, he is keenly interested in policies that support small businesses and the energy sector, given the potential impact on his job security and the regional economy. In the upcoming elections, Mark plans to vote for candidates who share his conservative views and are committed to promoting free-market principles."
