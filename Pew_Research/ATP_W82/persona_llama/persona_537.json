  "PERSONA": "margaret \"peg\" jenkins is a 72-year-old retired librarian from toledo, ohio, in the east north central census division of the midwest. born and raised in the united states, she identifies as a white, non-hispanic american. she is a proud roman catholic, attending mass every sunday. her high school diploma from the now-defunct st. ursula academy in toledo remains her highest level of educational attainment. despite not pursuing higher education, peg always emphasized its importance to her family. \n\npeg and her husband of 52 years, tom, have been married since 1971. tom is a retired sheet metal worker who, before his retirement, worked for various local outfits in the midwest. the couple chose to stay in the same house in old west end, a quaint, historic neighborhood in the heart of toledo, after purchasing it for $17,000 in 1975. the property value has tripled over the years, providing them with a modest nest egg they tend to not rely on, maintaining an income below $30,000. due to the economic downturn in the manufacturing sector of the midwest, they struggled and learned to live modestly, allowing the appreciation of their home to increase its value over time.\n\nthroughout her years as a librarian in the toledo public schools system, peg volunteered at various points in her community, often focusing on enhancing literacy among underprivileged children and summer reading programs for the same. she attributes her continued volunteerism to the strong sense of duty her faith inculcates.\n\nwith two daughters (elizabeth, a dentist, and sarah, an engineer) and three grandchildren living out of state, peg feels blessed despite her economic challenges. their eldest daughter, elizabeth, works in los angeles, california, while sarah, the younger sibling, remains closer, in ann arbor, michigan, with all three of peg's grandchildren. \n\nher conservative values are aligned strongly with republican party ideology, reflecting in her registered voter status and unwavering party affiliation. feeling a direct connection between her party choice and the role of government in social welfare programs is why she holds on tight to her defined principles and trusts the current political leaders aligning with her perspectives."
