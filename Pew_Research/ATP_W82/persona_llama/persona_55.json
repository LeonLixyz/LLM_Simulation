  "PERSONA": "emily wilson, a 68-year-old widowed woman, lives in a small town of brownwood, texas, within the rural expanse of the west south central census division. a lifelong resident of the united states, emily was born in brownwood and has never lived outside of the south. she is non-hispanic white and identifies as a protestant, specifically belonging to the baptist denomination, with her faith playing an important role in her life. although she grew up attending church regularly, she now attends services only a few times a year, mainly on holidays and special occasions.\n\nemily's educational background consists of a high school diploma obtained from brownwood high school, which was sufficient for her to secure a job as an administrative assistant at a local insurance company. she worked for over 25 years, married her high school sweetheart, james, and together they had two children. after james passed away five years ago, emily found herself both emotionally and financially challenged, as she had to navigate the complexities of widowhood on a relatively tight budget.\n\nemily's household income is around $35,000 per year, which places her in the middle-income tier. she receives a combination of social security benefits, a modest pension from her husband's work, and manages a small plot of land she inherited from her family, where she grows vegetables and fruits to supplement her groceries. despite being in her late 60s, she still works part-time at the local library, 10 hours a week, for extra income.\n\nemily's views on politics tend to lean towards the republican party, largely influenced by her late husband's viewpoints and her small-town conservative upbringing. however, she does not strictly adhere to all republican policies and considers herself moderate. she is primarily concerned with local issues, such as the economic development of her community, access to quality healthcare, and supporting veterans, as her son is a veteran. emily rarely volunteers but contributes to local charities and is well-respected in her community for her kindness and generosity.\n\ngiven her age and moderate income, emily's internet usage is surprisingly high, with her using the internet several times a day for purposes such as emailing her children who live out of state, keeping up with current events, and shopping online for convenience. although emily is registered to vote, she has not been very active in local elections, mainly due to the lack of confidence in the electoral system. however, her views on policy issues are well-informed, based on her experience as a widow, employee, and community member in a small rural town. her voting decisions are swayed by economic concerns, small-town values, and her faith, which aligns more closely with conservative policies but also shows openness to moderate stances."
