  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nMeet Benjamin \"Ben\" Thompson, a 57-year-old white non-Hispanic male residing in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area in Utah. Ben is a devout Mormon, born and raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and attends church services once a week. He lives with his wife, Sarah, in a suburban neighborhood with a mix of single-family homes and apartment complexes, in an area known for its good schools and safe community. The Thompsons have two adult children, Emily (25) and Michael (22), who are both married and living independently. Emily is a teacher, and Michael works in software development.\n\nBen holds a Master's degree in Business Administration from Brigham Young University and has had a successful career in finance, specifically in banking. He currently works as a senior loan officer for a large regional bank in Salt Lake City, earning a salary of $120,000 per year. Sarah, his wife, has a degree in elementary education and is currently a part-time teacher at a local elementary school, supplementing their income with an additional $30,000 per year.\n\nBen's conservative views are deeply rooted in his Mormon faith and were further shaped by his business education and career in finance. He believes in limited government intervention in economic matters and advocates for lower taxes. As someone who has lived in Utah his entire life, Ben has a strong sense of community and participates in volunteer work, including serving on the board of a local charity that provides financial assistance to low-income families. His commitment to community service is reflective of his Mormon values and his belief in personal responsibility.\n\nThe Thompsons own a four-bedroom house they purchased 15 years ago for $320,000, which is now valued at approximately $600,000. They are careful about their expenses but enjoy traveling, with recent trips to Europe and Hawaii for their 30th wedding anniversary. Ben and his family are satisfied with their economic situation but are concerned about national issues, such as the rising national debt, healthcare costs, and immigration. Ben's views on these issues are conservative, aligning closely with the Republican Party platform.\n\nBen and his wife are avid users of the internet, often browsing news websites and social media platforms several times a day. They are both registered voters and participate in local and national elections, with Ben always leaning towards Republican candidates. His stance on issues like gun rights, abortion, and taxation aligns closely with conservative and Republican views.\n\nBen is concerned about the future of the country, particularly for his children and grandchildren, and sees his political participation as a way to ensure a better future for them. Despite his strong conservative views, Ben is open to listening to opposing viewpoints and values the democratic process. However, his commitment to his faith and conservative principles remains unwavering."
