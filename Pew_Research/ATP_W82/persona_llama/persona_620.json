  "PERSONA": "elizabeth \"liz\" goldberg is a 67-year-old widowed woman living in a small, rent-controlled apartment in the san francisco metropolitan area. born and raised in the united states, specifically in the pacific northwest, liz's early life was marked by modest means, with her parents working multiple jobs to make ends meet. this upbringing instilled in her a strong work ethic and appreciation for the importance of social safety nets.\n\nliz attended community college for two years, studying early childhood education but never completed her degree due to financial constraints and the need to enter the workforce. she worked as a preschool teacher's aide for over a decade before transitioning to administrative roles in a variety of small businesses, including a family-owned bakery and later a dental office. her last job, which she held for nearly 20 years, was as a receptionist and office manager at a local synagogue, where she became deeply involved in the community, even after retiring.\n\nliz's marriage to her high school sweetheart, david, lasted 40 years until his passing three years ago. together, they had two children, both of whom live out of state with their families. liz is especially proud of her children's achievements; her son is a professor at a small liberal arts college, and her daughter works for a non-profit focused on environmental policy. despite the distance, liz is close to her family and makes it a point to use video calls to stay updated on their lives.\n\nliz identifies as jewish and, although she doesn't attend religious services regularly, her faith plays a significant role in her personal values, particularly her commitment to social justice and support for marginalized communities. her late husband was more observant, and during their marriage, they would occasionally attend synagogue together. since his passing, liz participates in community activities and holiday events that keep her connected to her jewish heritage.\n\nliz is a registered democrat and leans moderate in her views, supporting policies that she believes will improve the lives of the most vulnerable. her political engagement has increased since her retirement, with a particular focus on healthcare, education, and environmental issues. she volunteers her time with a local political advocacy group, even though she marks \"no\" for volunteerism, as this role allows her to stay engaged in her community in meaningful ways that were not possible while she was working.\n\nliving on a fixed income can be challenging for liz, with her annual income slightly under $25,000 from her pension, social security, and a small amount of savings. her rent is subsidized, which helps, but she is keenly aware of the housing crisis in san francisco and its impact on younger generations. despite her financial constraints, liz prioritizes donations to causes she believes in, especially those supporting low-income families and social welfare programs.\n\nliz's economic concerns are centered around the rising cost of living, particularly housing and healthcare, and the impact of political polarization on national unity. her personal experience of living on a limited income has deepened her support for progressive economic policies aimed at reducing income inequality and strengthening social safety nets. however, her moderate stance also makes her skeptical of overly drastic changes, preferring incremental, evidence-based reforms.\n\nin her leisure time, liz enjoys gardening in a community garden plot near her apartment, reading historical fiction, and practicing yoga to manage her arthritis. her days are filled with a mix of personal projects, community activities, and staying connected with her family and friends, which she believes are essential for her well-being in this phase of her life."
