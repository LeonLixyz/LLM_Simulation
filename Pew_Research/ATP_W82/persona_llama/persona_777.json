  "PERSONA": "###\n\nmeet deborah \"debbie\" johnson, a 56-year-old married woman living in the metropolitan area of portland, oregon, in the pacific west region of the united states. born in portland, debbie grew up in a modest household with her parents and two younger siblings. she is a high school graduate, having attended grant high school, and never pursued higher education due to her family's financial situation. after high school, debbie worked various entry-level jobs before settling on a career as a part-time administrative assistant for a local non-profit organization focused on community development, where she has worked for the past 15 years.\n\ndebbie and her husband, michael, a retired truck driver, have been married for 30 years. they bought a modest, single-family home in the piedmont neighborhood of portland about 20 years ago through a first-time homebuyer program. their home, valued at around $380,000, has been a significant source of stress due to rising property taxes, but they are determined to hold onto it as it represents their life's work. they have two children, both of whom are in their late 20s and no longer live with them. their son is a mechanic, and their daughter is a part-time nurse.\n\ndebbie is deeply involved in her community, especially through her church, where she attends services more than once a week. her faith is a significant part of her life, guiding many of her decisions and worldview. she considers herself a born-again christian and values her relationship with her community through the church. debbie is also an active volunteer at a local food bank and participates in neighborhood clean-up initiatives.\n\ndespite identifying as a conservative, debbie doesn't affiliate with either major political party, instead choosing to be an independent due to her frustration with the political polarization she observes. she feels that the current system doesn't sufficiently address the needs of the working class and the lower-income families she interacts with through her non-profit work. her political leanings are more conservative on social issues, such as family values and religious freedom, but she is more moderate on economic policies, advocating for support of local businesses and programs that help low-income families.\n\ndebbie and her husband live on a tight budget. their household income, combined, is around $37,000 annually, which puts them in a lower-income bracket. this forces them to make tough financial decisions, prioritizing mortgage payments, utilities, and saving for unexpected medical bills over discretionary spending. healthcare costs, given michael's ongoing health issues and her own chronic back pain, are a constant worry. debbie's concerns about healthcare affordability and access often influence her views on political candidates and their proposed policies.\n\ndebbie uses the internet several times a day for communication, work, and volunteering tasks. she is not very active in social media but keeps up with local news and discussions through community forums and local newspaper websites. despite her limited economic resources, debbie is adamant about making her voice heard and values her right to vote, ensuring she always updates her voter registration when necessary.\n\ndebbie's greatest economic concern is ensuring that her family's modest lifestyle is preserved and that they can afford to live comfortably without needing to downsize their home or drastically change their living standards. politically, she looks for candidates who support local communities, address healthcare accessibility, and promote fair labor practices. her conservative views on social issues often lead her to vote for candidates who align with those beliefs, but she is open to supporting moderate candidates who address her economic concerns effectively."
