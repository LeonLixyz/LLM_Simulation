  "PERSONA": "meet agust\u00edn \"gus\" rivera, a 72-year-old retired factory worker living in a small, rural town in the east north central division of the midwest. gus is a widower, having lost his wife, luz, three years ago after 40 years of marriage. born in ponce, puerto rico, gus moved to the united states mainland in 1979 with luz for better job opportunities. he became a u.s. citizen in 1985 and identifies as white, non-hispanic. gus and luz have two adult children, elena and carlos, who both moved to nearby metropolitan areas for college and career opportunities but regularly visit their father.\n\ngus attended high school in ponce but didn't graduate, starting work as an apprentice in an auto body shop at 16. when he moved to the midwest, he found employment in the auto manufacturing sector, working his way up to become a shift supervisor at a local factory before retiring at 68. gus's retirement has been modest, living off a combination of social security and a small pension. his annual income is approximately $25,000, making him part of the lower-income bracket. despite the financial constraints, gus owns his home, a small, well-maintained ranch-style house he bought with luz in the late 1980s. he doesn't have any mortgages but deals with rising property taxes and utility bills.\n\ngus's strong faith in the roman catholic church plays a significant role in his life. he attends mass every week at his local parish and occasionally helps with voluntary tasks, such as serving at the food bank. gus's religious beliefs influence his stance on social issues, such as abortion, but his political leanings are somewhat moderate to liberal, supporting certain democratic policies that aid lower-income families, even though he identifies as a republican. gus's son, carlos, a college professor, often discusses politics with him, which gus believes keeps him more open-minded to different perspectives.\n\ngus is concerned about healthcare, specifically, and the impact of policy changes on his medicare benefits. he also worries about the local economy, as the town has seen the decline of manufacturing jobs, including the closure of the factory where he worked. gus's experience has shown him the importance of community and the need for strong local economic support.\n\nin his personal time, gus enjoys visiting the community center for coffee and conversation with friends. he does not use the internet much due to a lack of familiarity, relying on local news and his children to stay informed. gus hopes that whoever is elected will prioritize creating more jobs in the area and not overlook the struggles of the aging population, especially those nearing or below the poverty line."
