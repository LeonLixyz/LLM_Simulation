  "PERSONA": "bradley aaron thompson is a 37-year-old white non-hispanic male living alone in a rented one-bedroom apartment in the metropolitan area of charlotte, north carolina. born and raised in the south atlantic region, bradley has spent his entire life in the united states and identifies as a conservative protestant. \n\nbradley graduated from high school in 2005 but chose not to attend college due to the rising costs and his family's modest financial situation at the time. his parents were staunch republicans, which heavily influenced bradley's early political views. despite these roots, bradley's reluctance to affiliate with any specific party stems from his skepticism towards the current political climate.\n\nbradley works as a sales associate at a local car dealership, making approximately $38,000 per year. the unstable nature of his job and the relatively modest income forces bradley to be mindful of his expenses, causing him to worry about financial security and eventually believing the government should reduce taxes to ease the economic burden on its citizens.\n\nhe attends church services only occasionally, recently stood against same-sex marriage, opposed stricter gun control regulations, and claims that economic growth can be bolstered by consuming less and saving more. outside of his dealership work, he spends an excessive amount of time browsing the internet to catch up with his friends on forums such as reddit. bradley's coping mechanisms from economic and social stress include an increasingly close online gaming community, making and saving food, and understanding the community-led causes he can participate in (albeit not by donating time or money)."
