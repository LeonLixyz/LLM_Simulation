  "PERSONA": "jesse alexander wilson, a 38-year-old non-denominational protestant from a small town in the east south central region of kentucky. born in pikeville, kentucky, jesse still resides in the same town, surrounded by the appalachian mountains, where his family has lived for generations. he lives in a small, two-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of town, which he rents for $750 per month. jesse's annual household income is approximately $28,000, mostly from his job as a mechanic at a local auto repair shop.\n\njesse's parents were high school sweethearts who never attended college but worked hard to provide for him and his younger sister. jesse followed in their footsteps, attending the local community college for two years and earning an associate's degree in automotive repair. after college, he spent a few years working at a dealership but eventually moved on to open his own small shop with a friend. however, due to financial difficulties, the business folded, and jesse went back to working for someone else. \n\njesse's education level and career trajectory have given him a strong foundation in his community but also limited his opportunities for higher-paying jobs. as a result, his economic concerns often focus on job security, affordable healthcare, and increasing his earning potential without sacrificing the gradual stability he has built over the years.\n\nwhile jesse identifies as a born-again christian and occasionally attends the non-denominational pikeville community church, his religious practice is not as consistent as it once was. he mostly attends church on holidays or during significant life events. jesse's strong upbringing in the church instilled in him a solid moral compass, but he finds it challenging to reconcile his faith with the economic hardships he has faced.\n\npolitically, jesse identifies as an independent but leans toward the republican party primarily due to his family's history and his perception of conservative values aligning with his upbringing. his ideology is more moderate, especially on social issues, but fiscally conservative. he is registered to vote and actively participates in local elections, feeling it's his duty to contribute to the decision-making process that affects his community.\n\njesse spends most of his free time online, often browsing through forums and social media, staying up-to-date on local news and national politics. his moderate and somewhat liberal views within the republican party are shaped by his experiences and the internet's influence, which exposes him to diverse perspectives on social and economic issues. jesse seldom volunteers, mainly due to his busy work schedule and feeling overwhelmed with personal responsibilities.\n\njesse's life is relatively simple, with his major focus on making ends meet and creating a stable future. his experiences have made him pragmatic and keenly aware of the importance of both hard work and community support."
