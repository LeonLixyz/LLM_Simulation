  "PERSONA": "rochelle thompson is a 42-year-old african-american woman living in the metropolitan area of kansas city, missouri, in the midwest region of the united states. born and raised in a low-income neighborhood in kansas city, rochelle never had the opportunity to pursue higher education beyond high school due to financial constraints. she attended a local community high school and graduated at 18. \n\nshe was married very young but separated from her husband after seven years due to his struggle with addiction. the separation process has been emotionally challenging, but she remains focused on raising her 12-year-old son, kofi, and providing for his needs as a single mother.\n\nrochelle holds conservative views but has always voted democrat since 18; her allegiance to the party stems from self-identified demographic representation. despite her religious upbringing and identity as a protestant, her church attendance has decreased significantly since her separation, and she now attends services only a few times a year. \n\nfor the past five years, rochelle has been working as a sales associate at a local department store, with a modest annual income of $25,500. despite her relatively stable job, her family income still falls below $30,000. housing assistance helps cover some of her living expenses, but there isn't much room in her budget for anything else beyond basic necessities.\n\nrochelle rents a two-bedroom apartment on the city's eastside. she struggles to save due to the high costs of providing for her child as a single parent and living paycheck-to-paycheck. recently, her landlord announced rent hikes and she worries she might have to choose between food and housing. earning just enough to avoid welfare or the food bank can make the search for better-paid job more urgent; however, the search hasn't yet yielded solid prospects. housing assistance can be unpredictable and may soon be unavailable.\n\nrochelle's view of politics is being more practical - she expects policymakers to alleviate the economic stress by creating better employment opportunities or introducing subsistence-level wages to uplift single parents."
