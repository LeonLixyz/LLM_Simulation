  "PERSONA": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n### PERSONA ###\n\nEmily Wilson, a 26-year-old white, non-Hispanic woman, was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, within the South Atlantic census division. She identifies as a Mormon (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS) and attends religious services a few times a year. Emily graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a Bachelor's degree in Education and is currently working as an elementary school teacher in the Henrico County Public Schools system, earning a salary of $35,000 annually.\n\nEmily has been in a long-term relationship with her partner, Ryan, and the couple lives together in a cozy two-bedroom apartment in the suburbs of Richmond. They pay $1,200 per month in rent and share household expenses. While they own a 2015 Honda Civic, they struggle to save for a down payment on a home due to their modest income and student loan payments.\n\nAs a registered voter and self-identified Republican, Emily leans towards conservative ideologies, aligning with her upbringing in a traditional Mormon household. Her views on economic policies are shaped by her experiences teaching in an underfunded public school system. Emily is concerned about the lack of resources for her students and advocates for increased government spending on education. However, she also supports lower taxes and reduced government involvement in private businesses.\n\nDespite being an active internet user, Emily rarely engages in online activism or volunteerism. She prefers to dedicate her free time to her partner and participate in local community events, such as charity fundraisers and church functions.\n\nEmily's daily routine involves waking up early, exercising, and then heading to school. She spends her evenings planning lessons and grading assignments. On the weekends, Emily likes to explore the local art scene, take long walks along the James River, and attend church services with Ryan.\n\nIn terms of economic priorities, Emily focuses on issues affecting her community, such as affordable housing, improved public transportation, and increased funding for public education. Her conservative views on social issues stem from her religious background, but she remains open to compromise and constructive dialogue on contentious topics.\n\nEmily's values are deeply rooted in her Mormon faith, which emphasizes the importance of family, hard work, and community service. As she navigates her young adult life, Emily strives to balance her personal and professional responsibilities while remaining committed to her conservative principles and community involvement."
