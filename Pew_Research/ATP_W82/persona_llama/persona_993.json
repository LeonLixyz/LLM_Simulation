  "PERSONA": "the individual is a 25-year-old non-binary person named jamie. they identify as black or african-american and were born and raised in a metropolitan area within the south atlantic region, specifically in the city of atlanta, georgia. with both parents being high school sweethearts who later attended the same historically black college, jamie was instilled with the importance of higher education from a young age. they pursued a graduate degree in public policy at georgia state university, completing their master's at the age of 24. jamie's degree has led to a career as a policy analyst for a local non-profit focusing on community development and racial equity in atlanta.\n\njamie currently lives with their partner, alex, in a rented townhouse in the west end neighborhood of atlanta. their partner, a freelance writer, works on a part-time basis, contributing to the household income. jamie's annual income of $72,500 from the non-profit, combined with alex's variable income averaging around $15,000 per year from writing jobs, places them firmly in the middle-income bracket with a household income of approximately $87,500.\n\nas an independent, jamie generally leans democratic but values their independence from parties, which aligns with their self-described conservative and moderate views. this stance is reflective of their pragmatic approach to problem-solving and willingness to listen to various perspectives. jamie's conservative trait is particularly evident in their personal financial management, as they prioritize saving for long-term goals, such as buying a house, over immediate desires.\n\njamie and alex are in the process of planning their future, with a possible wedding in the next two years and the goal of starting a family not too far off in the horizon. as such, they are deeply invested in community issues related to education, housing affordability, and healthcare accessibility. their religious beliefs are not centralized in organized religion, as they occasionally attend a local multi-faith community gathering that reflects their spiritual but not traditionally religious upbringing. this aspect of their life plays a role in shaping their broad social justice advocacy and volunteer work, which they believe is integral to creating positive change in their community.\n\njamie's extensive internet use is largely for staying updated on news, networking for work, and engaging in online communities focused on policy and social change. this digital engagement fuels both their volunteerism and professional life, enabling them to be more informed and active in their pursuit of a more equitable society.\n\nas a registered voter who prioritizes civic engagement, jamie regularly exercises their right to vote and encourages others to do the same. their moderate-conservative stance as a democrat often leads them to seek candidates who take a balanced approach to governance, particularly focusing on practical, community-driven solutions rather than strictly party-line ideologies.\n\njamie's economic concerns revolve around affordability and accessibility, hoping for policies that make housing, quality education, and healthcare more feasible for individuals across different income levels. they support initiatives that foster economic growth without neglecting the need for environmental sustainability and social responsibility. with a strong sense of community and a commitment to social justice, jamie navigates political landscapes with a pragmatic blend of idealism and realism."
