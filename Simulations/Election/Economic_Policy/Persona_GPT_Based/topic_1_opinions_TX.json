What should the top corporate tax rate be?\n\nCandidates' Stances:\n- A: Donald Trump (Former U.S. President, businessman)\n  Stance: The 2017 Trump tax law lowered the top personal tax rate rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent and the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.\n\n- B: Kamala Harris (Current U.S. Vice President, former Senator)\n  Stance: Harris wants to raise taxes on corporations and the highest earners, following Biden's budget. But she broke with Biden on raising the capital gains tax rate, saying she supports a rate of 28 percent, compared with 44.6 percent for Biden, for those earning more than $1 million (the current rate is 23.6 percent). She also proposed expanding tax deductions for small businesses. She backs increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent and has promised not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 per year. She wants to restore and expand the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, including a $6,000 child tax credit for the first year of a newborn's life.\n\n### YOUR RESPONSE ###\n\nPlease provide your response following the format above. **You must strictly adhere to the specified format.

      "reason": "as a low-income individual without health insurance, maria's primary concerns revolve around accessing affordable healthcare and maintaining financial stability. a candidate who proposes increasing taxes on corporations and the highest earners, while promising not to raise taxes on lower-income individuals and expanding tax credits for low-income families, would be more appealing to maria. this stance would allow her to benefit from increased social programs and potentially improved access to healthcare, without additional financial burdens.",

      "reason": "as a kindergarten teacher supplementing her income through private tutoring and a youtube channel, maria values policies that benefit working-class individuals and support education. given her economic situation and emphasis on community and social safety nets, maria is likely to support policies that reduce economic inequality and promote fairness in taxation, particularly those that spare lower and middle-class earners. she would likely oppose significant increases in taxes on lower and middle-class individuals while considering higher tax rates for corporations and high-income earners.",
