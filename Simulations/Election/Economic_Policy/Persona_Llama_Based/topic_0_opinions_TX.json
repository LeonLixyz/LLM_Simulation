What, if anything, needs to be done to control the costs of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare?\n\nCandidates' Stances:\n- A: Donald Trump (Former U.S. President, businessman)\n  Stance: Trump has promised to protect Social Security and Medicare, which are the biggest drivers of the national debt. \"Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security,\" Trump said in a January 2023 video message distributed by his campaign. The national debt increased by $7.8 trillion during Trump's presidency, the third-biggest increase relative to the U.S. economy's size, ProPublica reported.\n\n- B: Kamala Harris (Current U.S. Vice President, former Senator)\n  Stance: Harris wants to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, according to her campaign, but she has yet to release detailed policy proposals. She has taken the Biden administration stance on Social Security, supporting a measure to reinstate the payroll tax on earned income above $400,000. She has also said she would as president allow Medicare to accelerate negotiations on prescription drug prices, which are part of the administration's existing efforts to lower drug costs. In 2019, she co-sponsored a bill to expand Social Security by extending the payroll tax. She proposed a Medicare-for-All plan during her 2020 presidential bid, but she is not pursuing such a policy now.\n\n### YOUR RESPONSE ###\n\nPlease provide your response following the format above. **You must strictly adhere to the specified format.

      "reason": "as a moderate democrat and a young family man, jamal is likely to prioritize the protection and strengthening of social security and medicare, which are crucial for his family's financial security, especially as he is the primary household earner. his concerns about income inequality and access to affordable healthcare would lead him to support policies that benefit the middle class and control the costs of entitlements without reducing benefits. jamal would be skeptical of policies that could compromise the financial stability of his family and others like him.",
