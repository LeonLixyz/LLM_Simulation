  "topic": "###QUESTION###\n\nTopic: Tax policy\n\nQuestion: What should the top federal personal income tax rate be and at what income level should it hit? What should the top corporate tax rate be?\n\nCandidates' Stances:\n- A: Donald Trump (Former U.S. President, businessman)\n  Stance: The 2017 Trump tax law lowered the top personal tax rate rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent and the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.\n\n- B: Kamala Harris (Current U.S. Vice President, former Senator)\n  Stance: Harris wants to raise taxes on corporations and the highest earners, following Biden's budget. But she broke with Biden on raising the capital gains tax rate, saying she supports a rate of 28 percent, compared with 44.6 percent for Biden, for those earning more than $1 million (the current rate is 23.6 percent). She also proposed expanding tax deductions for small businesses. She backs increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent and has promised not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 per year. She wants to restore and expand the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, including a $6,000 child tax credit for the first year of a newborn's life.\n\n### YOUR RESPONSE ###\n\nPlease provide your response following the format above. **You must strictly adhere to the specified format.
