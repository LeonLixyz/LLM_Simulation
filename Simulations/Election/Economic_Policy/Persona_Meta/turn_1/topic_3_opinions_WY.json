There's no public evidence he would support a decrease in military spending even as he has called for deep cuts to domestic outlays because the government is \"spending money like drunken sailors.\"\n\n- B: Kamala Harris (Current U.S. Vice President, former Senator)\n  Stance: The Biden-Harris administration has proposed an $849.8 billion defense budget for fiscal year 2025, which represents a 4.1 percent increase from fiscal 2023 levels that were enacted, according to the Brookings Institute.\n\n",
