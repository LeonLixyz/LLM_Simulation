That was the biggest tax overhaul in decades, aimed at simplifying the tax code and promoting growth and investment.\nThe largest cuts went to businesses and the wealthy, which Democrats have called to reverse.\nThe Republican also wants to shave a further percentage point off corporation tax - and has floated an even bigger cut to 15%.\nHe has proposed making tipped income tax free, a proposal that his opponent Kamala Harris subsequently backed, too.\nTrump has also called on abolishing the tax on Social Security payments, a move that would be welcomed by retired Americans but would at the same time punch a big hole in the fund.\n\n- B: Kamala Harris (Current U.S. Vice President, former Senator)\n  Stance: In 2017, while a senator, Ms Harris supported a number of progressive tax programmes, co-sponsoring a bill with Bernie Sanders to expand social security for the elderly by increasing the tax rate on investments.\nAs a presidential candidate in 2019, she supported a corporate tax rate of 35%, up from 21%.\nThis was more aggressive than President Biden's proposal, which she also supported, of an increase to 28%.\nA campaign official told the BBC that the vice-president would continue to back President Biden's proposal of not raising taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000\nMs Harris said during her DNC acceptance speech that she would \"pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans\".\nAt the time of the speech, the details of the tax cut were unclear.\nThe Harris campaign later filled in the detail, saying that through the restoration of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit more Americans will be able to keep more of their income.\nRestoring the expanded Child Tax Credit would give families with newborn children a $6,000 tax cut.\n\n### YOUR RESPONSE ###\n\nPlease provide your response following the format above. **You must strictly adhere to the specified format.

Despite the challenges of being a teenage mother, Maria's strong support system, including her parents and extended family, encouraged her to pursue higher education. She is currently enrolled as a part-time student at Austin Community College, studying to become a dental hygienist.\n\nMaria's husband, Carlos, is currently incarcerated, and she is separated from him due to his struggles with substance abuse. Despite this, Maria remains committed to her marriage and is hopeful for his rehabilitation and eventual return to their family. Maria's relationship with Carlos is complex, and she struggles with the emotional and financial burdens of raising their children alone.\n\nAs a non-English dominant household, Spanish is the primary language spoken at home, but Maria speaks English well, which has been essential for her interactions with her children's schools, healthcare providers, and social services. Maria's language skills have also enabled her to navigate the complexities of the U.S. healthcare system, ensuring her family receives the necessary medical attention.\n\nMaria's employment status is currently unemployed, but she has been actively seeking a part-time job that accommodates her class schedule and childcare responsibilities. Her career aspirations are focused on the healthcare sector, where she hopes to secure a stable and fulfilling job as a dental hygienist.\n\nMaria's household income is supplemented by public assistance programs, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Despite the challenges of living on a limited budget, Maria prioritizes her children's education and well-being, often sacrificing her own needs to ensure they have access to quality childcare, nutritious food, and stable housing.\n\nMaria's economic concerns are centered around affordable healthcare, education, and job opportunities.

She is skeptical of politicians who promise quick fixes but is hopeful that genuine leaders will emerge to address the complex issues facing her community.
