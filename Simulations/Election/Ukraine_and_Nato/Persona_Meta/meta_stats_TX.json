Mr Biden signed off $61bn in military aid for Ukraine in April.\nOn Nato, he thinks countries that fall short of the advisory 2% of GDP spent on defence should forego the protection that comes with membership.\n\n- B: Kamala Harris (Current U.S. Vice President, former Senator)\n  Stance: Unlikely to stop the Ukraine War.\n\n### YOUR RESPONSE ###\n\nPlease provide your response following the format above. **You must strictly adhere to the specified format.
