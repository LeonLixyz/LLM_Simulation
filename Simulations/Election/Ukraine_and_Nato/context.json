                "stance": "Ms Harris's early career focused largely on domestic issues and the state of California, but she has become more involved in foreign policy since she was elected to the US Senate.\nAs vice-president, she has met 150 world leaders and visited 21 countries.\nShe attended the Munich Security Conference in the past year, and delivered remarks in support of western security alliance Nato that denounced isolationism and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nMs Harris has vowed to support Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\", and represented the US at Kyiv's \"peace conference\" in Switzerland.\nIn her speech at the Democratic convention, she noted that she met President Volodymyr Zelensky to \"warn him about Russia's plan to invade\" five days before Russia invaded, and \"helped mobilise a global response\" after the war began.\nThe vice-president also pledged, if elected, to ensure that \"America - not China - wins the competition for the 21st Century\" and to shoulder the responsibility of US leadership."
