Born and raised in the United States, specifically in this part of Florida, Tom identifies as White and Non-Hispanic. He resides with his wife, Margaret, in a modest, two-bedroom apartment in a quiet, suburban neighborhood with neatly manicured lawns. The couple has two adult children, both whom have moved out and started their own families, and four grandchildren.\n\n### Education and Career ###\n\nTom's educational background is marked by two years of community college, where he studied business administration but did not complete his degree due to family obligations. This background in business has served him well, even if the formal education was cut short. He has worked his entire life, mainly in the retail sector, with his most recent job being a sales associate at a local hardware store. However, after 40 years of dedicated service, Tom retired at 65, citing the desire to spend more time with his family and pursue his hobbies. His annual income, derived from a combination of his retirement savings, Social Security, and a part-time job, is just below the $30,000 mark, qualifying his household as lower-middle income.\n\n### Economic and Political Views ###\n\nEconomically, Tom's household faces challenges, as his fixed income barely covers the expenses, including rent, groceries, and medication for his chronic health conditions. Despite these financial strains, Tom's conservative views lead him to advocate for limited government intervention in economic matters. He believes in individual responsibility and the free market, supporting policies that promote job creation without increasing the national debt. His political perspective is also influenced by his strong religious beliefs; as an active Roman Catholic, Tom's stance on social issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, is conservative.\n\nTom is an avid supporter of the Republican party and a registered voter, exercising his right to vote in every election. His political engagement is also reflected in his activities as a volunteer for local candidates he supports, often helping with campaigns in his community.\n\n### Lifestyle and Leisure ###\n\nOutside of politics, Tom enjoys volunteering at his church, participating in weekly Bible study groups, and attending religious services every Sunday. He uses the internet about once a day to stay informed about current events, check his email, and occasionally browse for products he might need, though he's not very tech-savvy. In his free time, Tom enjoys gardening, woodworking, and fishing, activities he finds not only relaxing but also fulfilling, as they allow him to spend time outdoors and be close to nature.\n\n### Economic Concerns and Priorities ###\n\nTom's main economic concerns revolve around ensuring a stable financial future for his family and coping with the rising costs of healthcare and daily living expenses on a fixed income. His support for conservative economic policies stems from a desire to foster an environment conducive to personal responsibility and free enterprise, believing these values are essential for economic growth and stability.\n\n### Personal Values and Beliefs ###\n\nAt his core, Tom is driven by a strong sense of family, community, and faith. His personal values are deeply intertwined with his religious beliefs, emphasizing the importance of moral integrity, compassion, and service to others. Politically, his conservative stance is a reflection of these values, leading him to support candidates and policies that align with his views on traditional family values and individual rights.\n\nOverall, Tom Sullivan represents a quintessential conservative American, guided by his faith, personal values, and a strong sense of community, influencing his economic and political outlook."
